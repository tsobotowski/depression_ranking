Sam used to hang out with a pretty close knit group of people he has known since high school, but that group had a major social fallout/divide right around the time he and I got together, and they sort of split into two groups, each emphasizing a super annoying trait in the whole group - one group couldn't grow up and were slackers and couldn't take anything seriously, and the other group were gossipy and kind of jerks.</TEXT>

We split up our list into three initial groups - 

A: those we know for a fact are coming (parents, siblings, wedding party, other very close family)
B: those who we think are probably going to come, at least for the wedding day but probably for the weekend (fringe family, old friends) 
C: those who probably won't be there but at least needed an invitation (far away family we haven't seen in a while, busy family friends, people we haven't seen in a while but used to really care about) 

Each of those is in a column.</TEXT>

Basically the key to using flowers next to lights is LEDs - you MUST use an LED bulb or the lights just get too hot and can be a fire hazard.</TEXT>

The electrical stuff is not my area of expertise, my guy did that and it looks a little patched together and I'm not sure that's the right way to do things... but basically we built a larger frame around an IKEA mirror with some cheap boards from Home Depot, and we drilled holes through the frame to put the flowers through so they'd be straight instead of having to bend or glue them, which would make them crooked since so many fake flowers have big plastic bases.</TEXT>

- Ferris Wheels 

- Any ride line really (they're not bad for people watching for sure) 

- Going up into the stands to watch it all (this is a favorite for my fianc and I, especially on the side facing Cosmic Meadow - you can still catch a set while you're sitting somewhere not too loud/crowded when you need a break) 

- Finding a table/bench near the center area is nice too.</TEXT>
