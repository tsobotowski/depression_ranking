Here's what Rogof says:

 The fact that, as the Lichter study shows, "A majority of Democratic statements (54 percent) were rated as mostly or entirely true, compared to only 18 percent of Republican statements," **probably** has more to do with how the statements were picked and the subjective bias of the fact checker involved than anything remotely empirical.</TEXT>

Here he is  quoting James Taranto in an attempt to refute Politifact:

 As the Wall Street Journal's James Taranto has consistently reported, the fact checking business often  too often for anyone's good  turns on matters of opinion rather than matters of "fact."</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1189_212_7</DOCNO>

Taranto is another right wing polemicist who is no doubt hurt that conservative statements are being shown in a negative light, so it's hard to take this opinion seriously.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1189_212_8</DOCNO>

* a student(s) complained he debunked the idea that policies helping black people caused the housing crash

* an Afropunk band's presence would not have been "safe and healthy"

Excuse me, but all of these sound explicitly like or hint at *conservative* oversensitivity, not a problem with "liberal students" as the title says.</TEXT>

Specifically, both Reisman and Consulting by RPM seem to completely ignore Piketty's main finding: that Capitalism in its normal state leads to a situation where inherited wealth accumulates more quickly than earned wealth, and that after a brief anomolous period, we are now going back to that.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>He is so hot headed, it's sometimes hard to tell whether there is a valid technical criticism or whether he's just objecting to the conclusions:

 The depths of Pikettys ignorance are such that he believes that capital accumulation not only does not raise real wages but reduces them, by allegedly increasing the share of national income that goes to profits and correspondingly reducing the share that goes to wages, while the overall total of what is produced remains unchanged or increases only very modestly, and then not by virtue of any contribution to production made by capital

He does provide a reference for this, but it's to a file on his local machine, not on the web, so it's impossible to validate.</TEXT>

Well, the truth is that it's the *modern* American condition, what we've been left with - two parents having to work just to make ends meet - while the tiny sliver at the top take all the societal gains.. Those few at the top with vast wealth, much of it inherited, can fail their way through life and still land on top because of the structure of modern capitalism.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>A computer is a simple mechanism, and can be implemented using very different components:

  * electronic (the kind you're using now)
  * [mechanical](http://hackaday.com/2011/03/25/mechanical-turing-machine-can-compute-anything-slowly/ )
  * [water and valves](http://www.inquisition.ca/en/info/artic/ordineau.htm )

Then, you just need a function that takes a list with a query operator as the first element and returns the parameter string:

    (defun query-param (qexp)
       (let ((op (first qexp))
             (op-args (rest qexp)))
          (apply (gethash op +query-operators+) op-args)))

And just map this method over the list:

    (mapcar #'query-param '((= first.name bob) (!</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1189_1535_2</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>= last.name jones)))

Which will yield a list of strings:

    ("first.name=bob" "last.name!=jones")

Which can be concatenated with FORMAT:

    (format nil "~{~a~^ ~}"
            (mapcar #'query-param '((= first.name bob) (!</TEXT>
        </DOC>

            	<DOCNO>s_1189_1535_3</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>= last.name jones))))

Which gives:

    "first.name=bob last.name!=jones"

Orangered is a strong color which Reddit uses to highlight and distinguish noteworthy elements:
   
   * user has upvoted an article
   * user has selected a tab (hot/new/etc)
   * user has new mail

Using orangered for # of upvotes adds a highlight on every line and creates a number of problems:
   
  * confuses the meaning of the highlight color
  * draws attention to a minor detail
  * reduces the readability of the site.</TEXT>
