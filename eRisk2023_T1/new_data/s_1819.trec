            	<TEXT>So I thought I would give you a definition into what this actually means

All Events that WWE Hold have a disclaimer saying "Card Subject To Change" this means that just because Bray Wyatt is booked to defend his championship in two months doesn't mean he will hold it because Card Subject To Change let's the consumer know that the matches on the card are not set in stone, and thus not a spoiler and thus you're not giving us all new information by posting about it.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1819_131_3</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

I thought I needed to clear this up considering I've seen 101 thousand posts about possible spoilers from house shows, hopefully this might decrease the number of these posts popping up.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1819_136_1</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> So after my pack luck recently I decided to open 20 of them and share what I get

1: Sokratis(84)   Gabi(82)

2: Bartra(81)   Reid(81)

3: Vardy(82)   Nkoulou(81)

6: Savi(82)   Carrasso(81)

7: Iborra(82)   Orellana(81)

8: Mertesacker(83)   Smolnikov(81)

9: Vierinha(81)   Carrasso(81)(DUPE)

10: Marchisio(86)   Gaitan(85)

11: Rulli(82)   Moya(81)

12: TOTT Kabor(81)   Shatov(81)

13: Subai(83)   Villa(82)

14: Trapp(83)   Falcao(81)

17: Oreallana(81)(DUPE)   Shawcross(81)

18: Isco(84)   Herrmann(81)

19: Glik(83)   Lamela(81)

20: Rulli(82)(DUPE)   Gignac(82)

So I could have stopped here but I went fuck it and I'm gonna open some more, so as a little Intermission here's 5 Gold upgrade packs:

1: Iturraspe(81)   Quagliarella(79)

2: Aspas(81)   Mcgeady(75)

3: Iturbe(77)   Gray(75)

28: IF Perrin(84)   Luiz Gustavo(83)

29: Konoplyanka(83)   Albiol(82)

            	<TEXT> So before the show we had a couple production errors, such as the tron showing the production desktop

**Match 1: The New Day (c) vs Enzo   Cass vs Cesaro   Sheamus vs The Club**

Pretty decent match, back and forth between the four teams, everyone got their stuff in.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1819_323_3</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

**Winners: The New Day**

**Match 2: Bo Dallas vs Neville**

Pretty short match, massive pop for Neville since he's from England, not much offence from bo and Neville hit the red arrow for the win

**Winner: Neville**

**Match 3: The Golden Truth   Darren Young vs The Shining Stars   Titus O' Neil**

So a strange note before the match, Darren Young was announced to be accompanied by Bob Backlund yet Bob was not at ring side for this match, anyway, there's was a few good spots like Goldust going on an atomic drop rampage and almost getting them disqualified and three atomic drops in sync, The faces won with the golden truths tag finisher

**Winners: The Golden Truth   Darren Young**

**Match 4: Chris Jericho vs Sami Zayn**

So Jericho came out first with the list of Jericho and cut a promo on how Leeds was not going on the list after the pop he got just before saying we're going on the list, he then offered the Gift Of Jericho, got another pop, said we didn't deserve that either, scattered sparkle crotch and Yorkshire chants during this promo, then Sami Zayn made his entrance, the crowd sang along with his theme, there was then about 3-4 minutes of Jericho telling the crowd to stop chanting things and refusing to take his scarf off.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1819_323_4</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Then there was about 7 minutes of a proper match with a walls of Jericho spot and Zayn missing a helluva kick, Zayn pinned Jericho after a Blue Thunder Bomb

**Winner: Sami Zayn**

**Match 5: Roman Reigns vs Rusev:**

Roman got cheered loudly, Rusev got mixed to negative response, same old same old Roman reigns and Rusev match, although when Lana got ejected the referee did the cartwheel that Jericho did during Reigns vs Rusev, Reigns won with a spear after breaking out of the accolade

**Winner: Roman Reigns**

*Intermission*

**Match 6: Sin Cara vs Curtis Axel**

Missed most of this match cause I was buying an Enzo And Cass Certified G Shirt and a drink, caught the finish with Sin Cara winning with a Swanton Bomb

**Winner: Sin Cara**

**Match 7: Charlotte, Dana Brooke   Nia Jax vs Bayley, Sasha Banks   Alicia Fox w/ Special Guest Referee Emma**

Emma seemed like a face first off with her interaction with the fans at ringside, right so standard women's six tag, they did a triple suicide dive and it seemed that Sasha landed on her ankle or something as she was down for about 5 minutes or so, anyway Dana Brooke was pinned by Bayley after a Bayley-To-Belly

**Winners: Bayley, Sasha Banks   Alicia Fox**

**Match 8 Kevin Owens vs Seth Rollins in aStreet Fight**

So there was a lot of chants for tables for some reason and a massive pop after KO put Seth through the first one, the match was about 10-15 minutes long, ending with a roll up by KO after a kendo stick to the mid section, Seth then put KO through a table with a buckle bomb onto a table leaning on the corner, Seth then cut a promo about how he finally made it to Leeds after getting injured just before it last year.</TEXT>

**Winner: Kevin Owens**

After The Show:

After the show my friend wanted to see the coach leave for some bizarre reason so we waited there for the superstars, KO, Seth and Sheamus were the only ones to bother to say goodbye to us the others, especially the women, shut the curtains on the coach so they couldn't be seen, we waved them off and someone, couldn't quite see who, waved back through the window of the coach

So that was WWE Leeds, good show overall</TEXT>

I don't want a Bullet Club rip off in WWE, 1: we've seen it before in the NWO 2: It would show a complete lack of creativity from creative, I would rather have Balor as the top face on raw, Styles as the top heel on Smackdown, Reigns as the top raw Heel and Ambtose as the top smackdown face, have Gallows and Anderson come into their own as a top tag team, these 4 are some of the best wrestlers of the world so why stick them all together, there's nothing to gain here for all 4 men, plus, knowing WWE, they'll probably just get buried like the nexus then have a new leader like Kevin Owens to try and get them back over.</TEXT>

Shawn Michaels: 225 lbs: Wrestlemania 12, Wrestlemania 14, Wrestlemania 20, Wrestlemania 23, Wrestlemania 26

Chris Jericho: 224 lbs: Wrestlemania 18

Chris Benoit: 220 lbs: Wrestlemania 20

The Miz: 221 lbs: Wrestlemania 27

Daniel Bryan: 210 lbs: Wrestlemania 30

Seth Rollins: 217 lbs: Wrestlemania 31 (I'm counting this as a triple threat as Seth Rollins cashed in during the match)

Bayley

Nia Jax

Just kidding, probably Dillinger

            	<TEXT> Splitting the women's division, in my opinion is an awful idea, there's not enough depth in the women's roster to justify splitting it up, if I think now who's active in the women's division then I have:

Sasha Banks

Charlotte

Dana Brooke

Becky Lynch

Natalya

Paige

6 main roster active women, Naomi and Tamina (Injured) have disappeared, Eva Marie hardly appears, Nikki is Injured, Lana and Maryse are managers rather than superstars
There's not enough to say the women should be split, even adding NXT superstars has what, 2 women ready to move up and ones the champion, Nia Jax and Carmella need time to develop into their potential, only Bayley and Asuka are ready and Bayley could do with a little work on the mic, the tag team division has enough depth to justify splitting it but the women don't, 8 people isn't nearly enough to fill out a division on two rosters.</TEXT>
