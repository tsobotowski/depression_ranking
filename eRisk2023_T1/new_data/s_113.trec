- warm your smoker up first... after your coals are ashen put them down and let them warm up the empty smoker... if it's a bit cool than add a bit more coal, give it a couple minutes.</TEXT>

- if  you have a cheapy sidebox burner like I do, there's probably a good bit of temperature difference from one side to another; there are online mods for common cheapies that help address this, but they don't completely fix it ... so I rotate the meat every once in a while.</TEXT>

If  you want to start running, I definitely encourage you to :  

a) go to /r/running specifically and start learning more, 

b) go to a Running store - not a sports store, not a shoe store, but a running store to get fitted with the proper shoes for your foot and gait.</TEXT>

In one day of constant drizzle marked by downpours on the AT this week  I saw very expensive membrane parkas on slow moving new hikers, I saw very fast packers just wearing windshirts (makes sense too, get wet, but at least you're keeping the wind chill off),umbrellas, me in my full on rubber rain coat, and folks who just wore nothing.</TEXT>

Does this also mean that if I want to continuously improve my cardio strength, ignoring running for the moment, that I actually need to increase my speed and distance not to become a better runner, but to keep my heart rate the same so that I'm providing the same level of relative excursion ?</TEXT>

Pros I see, as in leaning to keep: 
- Shipping it back would cost me at least something.</TEXT>

- Larger means not being able to easily work tight spaces

If I understand it correctly, I can borrow up to 100% of the completely value based on an appraisal, but I have to put 10% of the reno costs down, plus whatever cash down the mortage lender requires, but then I get to ammortize those reno costs over the life of the loan, drastically reducing cash outlays when buying.</TEXT>
