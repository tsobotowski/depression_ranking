One thing regarding noise: If you have a unit in the rear, to the right (if you are standing in front of the building), the GW students in the townhouses below and sometimes in the student housing (former hotel building) at K, sometimes hold very loud and noisy parties until 2-3 a.m. Generally, this noise never bothered me, but it could be more of an issue on lower floors.</TEXT>
