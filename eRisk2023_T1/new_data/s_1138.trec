Some notable lyrics:  
  
From "Inprint of the Un-Saved"  
The scattered jigsaw of my redemption laid out before my eyes  
Each piece as amorphous as the other - Each piece in its lack of shape a lie  
  
From "Disenchantment"
I stay my breath to escape this slavery  
I stay my breath to re-awake and face it encore  
The struggle to free myself of restraints, becomes my very shackles  
  
From "Re-Inanimate"  
My ignorance cast in the mold of all things absolute  
I sustain forever my gaze.</TEXT>

Resting in the inverted state of being dead, non-sensory matter  
As all the earth, the wind, the fire, the sea behold and learn to pity me  
  
From "Entrapment"  
Mutiny of self.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1138_58_5</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Insurrection games convincingly performed  
Incapacitated by physical thoughts acting out the will of tendon and bone  
  
From "Mind's Mirrors"  
The feeding frenzy of my starving soul, gnawing voraciously at the bones,  
the exo-skeletal patchwork protecting my own reflection within;  
The twin-and-same engaged in the mirrored act of chewing away  
at the shell of my attacking self.</TEXT>

A new level reached, where the absence of air lets me breathe  
I'm inverted electrical impulses.</TEXT>
