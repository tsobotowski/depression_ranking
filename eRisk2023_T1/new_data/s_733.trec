Holmes - A returner only, if he makes it and commits long term he can eventually be a 3rd/4th WR...

Then you arrive at a crossroads go down the Jason Nightingale path where your high workrate, finishing and versatility sees a productive career... or the Nathan Merritt path where while young will call upon freakish try scoring instincts but then as you move into your late 20's speed will drop off and season try tallies of single digits.</TEXT>

At the time i'm thinking WTF cause the stats were quite similar, about 3 missed tackles difference, 1 line break, possession had about a 2% swing and Darren lockyer says on air "umm no, you'll find that it's been pretty close and the second half is up in the air".</TEXT>
