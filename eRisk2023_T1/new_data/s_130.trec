Nic freezes for a bit and then gives me a wooden answer

Nah im probably just being paranoid

Haha, alrig-

Before I can finish talking he just turns around and walks towards the exit and says facing away, while walking: 


Imma grab lunch, see you

This shocked me more than most people probably would be from this occasion, because Nic is the person in this workshop that is the most social, most people get annoyed because he talks way too much and ive never seen him this way, so quiet.</TEXT>
