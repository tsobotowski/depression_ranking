            	<TEXT> For varieties sake, here is a less sentimental poem that I still love:

 -

The shortcut through the Corn field

tempts you as you're walking home

the clouds above keep the moon concealed

As you enter the swaying corn, alone.</TEXT>

 -

The corn grows tall and thick, my friend,

the path you chose is muddy

it grows in rows without scope or end

and in the dark, you hurry

 -

You don't see the standing forms

As you pass them on your way

they stand still amongst the swaying corn

which hides their pallor, and decay

 -

hundreds gather in this field tonight

though you see none at all

yet still you look around in fright

but the corn grows too thick, too tall

 -

You tell yourself as you continue through

"Its merely the rustling of the leaves,"

But they see you, and they hear you,

And they might not let you leave.</TEXT>

*-*

The corn grows tall and thick, my friend,

the path you chose is muddy

it grows in rows without scope or end 

and in the dark, you hurry

*-*

You don't see the standing forms

As you pass them on your way

they stand still amongst the swaying corn

which hides their pallor, and decay

*-*

hundreds gather in this field tonight

though you see none at all

yet still you look around in fright

but the corn grows too thick, too tall

*-*

You tell yourself as you continue through

"*Its merely the rustling of the leaves,*"

But they see you, and they hear you,

And they might not let you leave.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>

The crux of the argument is most people would agree that this level of spying is good when it is potentially dangerous individuals who represent a danger to innocent people being spied upon, but problem seems to be that  the NSA does not limit itself to that, and seems to have spent a great deal of time and effort spying on the American public en masse, as well as (according to recent news developments) various international offices and embassies.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>

This obvious does raise larger arguments such as the problem of deciding who represents a significant enough danger to society to warrant the level of privacy invasion the NSA seems to have wielded with such indiscrimination, and it could be easy to get drawn into a debate regarding racial, religious or social profiling.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>

So in answer to the question at hand: no, even if the NSA had successfully intercepted and stopped multiple terrorist attacks, this does not justify indiscriminate and Orwellian-like constant surveillance by the, or any, government on the population at large, as a whole.</TEXT>

The same can be said of the original distress call 'CQD', which is a combination of the original distress call of 'CQ' ('*scu*' from the French word *scurit*), then the D was added latter to stand for '*Distress*'.</TEXT>
