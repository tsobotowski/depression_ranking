What I did say was this:

It makes more sense to link to proof that Gorkov went to FSB spy school or the Maddow segment when she discusses this instead of the FSB wikipage

What I also asked you to do is instead of linking to the wiki-page for the FSB is that it makes more sense to link to link to proof that somebody is FSB trained, proof that somebody went to the Russian spy school instead of just a link to the wikipedia page for the FSB as background information.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>The reason I'm looking into the Canons 
-is primarily as an all aronud upgrade from my Nikon
-i can tell you i'm leaning toward the 60D, as the 7D as alot of nice features but really features i don't need such as the FPS.</TEXT>

-Lastly I would use the Canon as another HD Video camera as the DSLR for video is a trend that is picking up and some clients do like that style and it does fit certain applications.</TEXT>

-So I'm hoping for some input to just "reassure" me that the 60D is what I'm looking for, which after speaking with my local camera shops back home in NY (in school in Philadelphia) I'm feeling strongly towards that.</TEXT>
