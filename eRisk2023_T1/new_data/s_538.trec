            	<TEXT>Some tips from my experiences... Each tablet will last you about 15-60 minutes (generally about 30 before effects diminish), not ALL the sourness goes away (lemons do not taste like pure sugar), thoroughly dissolve the tablet in your mouth (3-5 minutes) and then wait a couple more for the full effect, and lastly, bitterness is NOT the same as sourness.</TEXT>

**Lemons/limes:** Taste like the best lemonade/limeade ever

**Pineapple:** Incredibly delicious, but almost TOO sweet for some people

**Oranges/orange juice:**  Really depends on the kind, but can substantially change the flavor

**Hot Sauce:** Vinegar almost tastes sugary, so it is both sweet and spicy

**Pickled items:** Again, vinegar becomes rather sweet

**Cheese:** Some cheeses taste like "dessert" cheese, especially sharp cheeses, cream cheese, cottage cheese, and goat cheese.</TEXT>

**Beer/Wine:** Not as profound as citrus, but definitely changes the flavor profile

Some ideas I'm currently thinking of are:

-Several flush mounted USB chargers for charging phones and other devices

-imbedded tablet(s) to control home automation and act as a control for my home theater server

-small ITX computer built within the table... not sure what I would do for a screen... Possible wireless display?</TEXT>
