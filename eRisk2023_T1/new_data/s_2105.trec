TLDR: You can get a few thousand underemployed college grads (that have no money to invest with you) to know your company name for roughly [$5,075.00](http://blog.transamerica.com/transamerica-san-francisco-meat-up-contest-contest-official-rules)

If 3000 Redditors take the time to comment and/or read the thread that's $1.69 a lead plus whatever you paid for the advertising.</TEXT>

This gave me two 0 to 9 numbers... 

00 to 04 was monster 1.... 05 to 09 was monster 2... etc

Spell example:


roll 0 to 9

If roll  (enemy evasion modifier) then attack hits and:

Base spell damage * (intellect score / 10) * (enemy resistance) * (armor bonus) * (random number to keep successive attacks adifferent amounts)

For spells there was a base power thst multiplied off your intellect and then multiplied by a random number modifier to make it unpredictable.</TEXT>

I realized any questions I asked had to be extremely specific, and offer no chance for creepy deviation in the answer.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_2105_209_64</DOCNO>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_2105_232_65</DOCNO>

            	<DOCNO>s_2105_232_67</DOCNO>
