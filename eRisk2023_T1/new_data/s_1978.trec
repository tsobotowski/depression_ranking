            	<TEXT>Putting her on the lease is not an option because of a few things: 

- the apartment is simply not big enough for four people (its a two bedroom apartment, and the room that I'm in isn't really a room)

- there is only three car spaces, with no other place to park within 3km (she currently parks in the visitor spot when she comes over, which residents aren't allowed to do)

- the landlord would not allow her back on the lease anyway, because she handled leaving so poorly last time (she basically just up and left and stopped paying rent - it was just luck that I happened to be moving around the same time because I was looking at other places before Roommate A asked me to take over the lease)

Having said all that though, myself and roommate A have discussed asking her to pay a share of the utilities bill when it comes next, based on her being here literally every weekend and having showers etc.</TEXT>

So there are a lot of issues at play here; Roommate B

- Never cleans up/washes his dirty dishes

- Never contributes to shared items for the household (toilet paper, cleaning products, milk etc.)</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1978_8_9</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

- Refuses to do stuff like take out the rubbish

- Has a total disregard for the noise he makes when other people are sleeping (Roommate A   myself both do shift work and generally work weekends while Roommate B has a day job and weekends off, so he's always having people over for drinks   coming home late over the weekend and just being as loud as fucking possible)

These are some of the more minor grievances, which are sort of a non-issue because of one thing - his girlfriend.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1978_8_19</DOCNO>

- She does her washing here (not all of it, but regularly enough to be noticed)

- She has her own bath towel   hook in the bathroom

- She frequently refers to the apartment as 'home' or 'our place'

- She will invite her friends to the apartment without letting any of us know (has brought them over for dinner)

And just yesterday she walked through our front door unannounced, with a friend, while Roommate B was not home (he had given her his key to get in).</TEXT>

The USB adapter I have uses a 8191s Realtek chipset, and on the Niresh installation all I had to do with download the Mac drivers from Realtek's website (used the ML drivers as they were the latest one).</TEXT>

Now, with the clean install, after installing the drivers and wireless utility app that comes with them (using the exact same install package that previously worked on 10.9) and then restarting (as per the installation instructions), the Wireless Utility app refuses to start.</TEXT>

Things that I have tried:

* Installing different/older versions of the driver (tried every driver available from realtek)

* Tried modified drivers from macbreaker forums

* Manually installing the kexts that are contained in the installer.pkg

All with multiple reboots - no dice.</TEXT>

One thing that does stick out to me, on the Niresh install, when viewing USB devices in System Report, it listed the USB as RTL8181S Wi-Fi Adaptor, whereas with the clean 10.9.4 install it is simply listed as Miscellaneous USB device - which makes me think its an issue with a missing or unmodified kext that had already come with Niresh and I have yet to install; only thing is, I have no clue how to figure out what I'm missing.</TEXT>

* It is common to still serve food that has been dropped on the floor
* Chips are often served 30+ minutes old in a slow period - the heater keeps them hot but they are still old chips (they are sometimes dipped back into the fryer to freshen them up)
* Stores would regurlarly re-date the desserts kept in the fridge - it was not uncommon for customers to come back complaining about their cheesecake or chocolate mousse being sour/out of date/otherwise off
* When food was returned to us (due to a customer complaint) it would often be re-used (with us having no idea what the customer has done to it during the time it took for them to bring it back)
* Our gravy and mashed potato is just made from powder + hot water (this one ain't so bad, cause it tastes fucking delicious anyway lol)
* Rooster rolls are made using 3+ day old chicken that they were unable to sell.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>They are made in the morning and kept in the fridge until close and are simply microwaved when they get ordered - it is not uncommon to find bones in them (kitchen staff have to strip the chicken from the carcass when making them, and kitchen staff are fucking lazy)
* If you order chips without salt, there's about an 80% chance they will simply drop already salted chips back into the fryer for a few seconds and then serve them to you
* Those banana fritters that everyone loves - has anyone tried pulling off the crumbs to see the banana underneath?</TEXT>

Because they are handling your message *anyway*, you can send and receive SMS on Verizon's website, and because they can match your account info with your #, it sends as your number.</TEXT>

If the former, you have to do the following steps:

* Flash stock recovery
* Flash latest stock ROM (if you are not already on it)

An OTA update will remove root and overwrite your radio (assuming there is a new one) so you will lose root and LTE.</TEXT>

**ROM Name:** Slim Bean

**ROM Version:** 4.3 Build 1 (09/15)

**Android Version:** 4.3

**Download Link:** [slimroms.net](http://www.slimroms.net/index.php/downloads)

**Kernel:** Slim-4.3-JWR-RC-1.1 (default ROM kernel)

**General Feedback:** I initially tried this ROM because it was one of the few ROMs that had a JWR+JSS hybrid kernel - I was on CM 10.2 nightlies w/ Franco kernel and I kept running into the JSS deadlock issue.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1978_441_2</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>I initially intended it to be a temporary thing but after running this ROM for a few days, there is nothing I miss from CM (read: SlimBean has all of CM's features) but I would certainly miss some features of this ROM if I went back, so it looks like I'll be staying for the foreseeable future.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>My favourite have been the way they handle custom navigation buttons/layouts (the UI/options for it are better than CM's implementation IMO, plus you can do things like have custom actions done on long-press of a button, which as far as I'm aware of, isn't available on CM) and transparent navbar and notification bar on the homescreen (which results in a simply beautiful [homescreen](http://i.imgur.com/c49K0Tk.jpg)).</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> **ROM Name:** Slim Bean

**ROM Version:** 4.3 Build 1 (09/15)

**Android Version:** 4.3

**Download Link:** [slimroms.net](http://www.slimroms.net/index.php/downloads)

**Kernel:** Slim-4.3-JWR-RC-1.1 (default ROM kernel)

**General Feedback:** I initially tried this ROM because it was one of the few ROMs that had a JWR+JSS hybrid kernel - I was on CM 10.2 nightlies w/ Franco kernel and I kept running into the JSS deadlock issue.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>I initially intended it to be a temporary thing but after running this ROM for a few days, there is nothing I miss from CM (read: SlimBean has all of CM's features) but I would certainly miss some features of this ROM if I went back, so it looks like I'll be staying for the foreseeable future.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>My favourite have been the way they handle custom navigation buttons/layouts (the UI/options for it are better than CM's implementation IMO, plus you can do things like have custom actions done on long-press of a button, which as far as I'm aware of, isn't available on CM) and transparent navbar and notification bar on the homescreen (which results in a simply beautiful [homescreen](http://i.imgur.com/c49K0Tk.jpg)).</TEXT>

[88SMS](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thinkleft.eightyeightsms.mms) - Pretty much the stock SMS pulled from Jellybean with some enhancements (such as quickmessage popup, night mode and emoji support)

[Textra](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.textra) - Quite nice.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Some people do it to look cool/for attention and others do it because they do derive pleasure for it and it is a coping mechanism... I am probably wrong here (I don't have a source for you and I'm on my phone) but I remember reading somewhere that self harm releases endorphins into the body in response to the pain, and people can get addicted to that as well.</TEXT>

There are also the psychological reasons behind it, such as feeling in control (when the self harmer feels that all other aspects of their life are out of their control, so they self harm because they can control the pain and it makes them feel empowered)

And say what you want about attention seeking, but if someone is so desperate for attention that they feel the only way to get it is to deface their body, don't you think they need some help, regardless of the severity of their self harm?</TEXT>

Alex decides to run through the bush directly to the road heading east from Cassowary Hill to Dugong lane on a bearing of 135^o T.

If she runs at V km/h on the road to Dugong lane and b% of V through the bush, evaluate whether this is the best heading to run on?</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> depression is

turning your phone off because you think nobody will try to text or call you anyway

having to deactivate your facebook so you arent tempted to impulsively post depressing and attention seeking statuses

being paranoid to the point where you ruin your friendships with people before they have the chance to hurt you

walking into your room and collapsing onto the floor and into tears as soon as youre out of everyones sight

having to say what?</TEXT>

looking at your school books and being unable to read or write anything because you just cant seem to think at all

getting angry at people when they touch you

not being hungry or feeling sick when you try to eat

the feeling of a constant weight on your shoulders

always being tired, no matter how much sleep you get

staying up all night because you dont want the next day to come

lying to your friends, psychologist and parents, telling them that youre getting better because you dont want to stress or worry them anymore

feeling like youd be better off dead

seeing the worst in people at all times

being unable to take a compliment or accept anything nice towards you

testing people to see if they actually care about you

overthinking things to the point where a kind gesture can become a hateful insult

spilling your whole story to people again and again in the hopes that maybe someone will save you

not being able to take a joke

having to fake a smile all day

hurting the people that you care about the most

asking yourself why cant you just be happy?</TEXT>

When I first got the camera, I put the 512mb card into it and hadn't taken it out until last night (I don't have a CF card reader so I simply plug my camera into my laptop and transfer the images that way, so there is almost no reason for me to take the CF card out.)</TEXT>
