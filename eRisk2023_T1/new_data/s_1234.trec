Basically, I explain the science behind why it's completely false that eating sugar alone can cause your body to store more fat via increased insulin production.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>I apologize if this is complex science, but my three arguments essentially boil down to this:

1) Insulin secretion is merely one of many mechanisms that can cause your body to store nutrients as fat.</TEXT>

Whey-derived amino acids:

-Enhance insulin secretion, by increasing GLP-1- and GIP-induced production of entoendocrine cells;

-Increase cellular uptake rate of triglycerides in the adipocytes; 

-Suppress production of adenosine deaminase complexing protein 2, thereby further increasing entoendrocrine hormone activity.</TEXT>

Yet, entoendocrine hormones also mediate glucose-dependent insulin secretion by increasing the pancreatic production rate of the glucagon hormone, which has been shown to reduce the stored glycogen rate of conversion to glucose (thus reducing blood glucose level), and which has also been shown to increase postprandial satiety via upstream interactions in the brain-liver neural axis upon meal initiation.</TEXT>

Carbohydrates are, by nature, insulinogenic, because pancreatic secretion of growth factors is directly glucose-dependent: when there is insufficient cellular energy to carry out a physiological process, which could be literally anything, be it an intracellular transfer, an extracellular transfer, or a contraction of any kind, the body responds by producing insulin, which will transport the nutrients until they reach the biochemical pathway that will ultimately result in the beginning of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, from which ATP is mainly produced.</TEXT>

Carbohydrates are, by nature, insulinogenic, because pancreatic secretion of growth factors is directly glucose-dependent: when there is insufficient cellular energy to carry out a physiological process, which could be literally anything, be it an intracellular transfer, an extracellular transfer, or a contraction of any kind, the body responds by producing insulin, which will transport the nutrients until they reach the biochemical pathway that will ultimately result in the beginning of the tricarboxylic acid cycle, from which ATP is mainly produced.</TEXT>

There are five factors that activate the mTORC1 pathway:

-availability of cellular energy (ATP);

-availability of growth factors such as insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (igf-1)

-availability of essential branched chain amino acids (BCAAs), especially leucine (found mostly in dairy and high protein food products)

-availability of another amino acid, glutamine, which works synergistically with leucine by acting as a 'gatekeeper' that ensures mTORC1 pathway leucine uptake (also found in dairy)

-availability of satured fatty acids, especially palmitic acid (found mainly in certain oils and cake pastries).</TEXT>

For example, milk is probably the most mTORC1 stimulating food that exists, since it is highly insulinogenic (since it's digested quickly), meaning that it causes the pancreas to secrete a lot of insulin and is therefore transported to the metabolic pathway at a relatively fast rate, and also because it is rich in leucine and glutamine.</TEXT>

Basically, his advice boil down to: 

-eat mostly lean meat, complex carbs and fruits and vegetables

-don't weight yourself everyday

-focus more on building strength and muscle in the gym, less on losing fat

-have fun losing weight and have a beer once in a while, it's about what you do most of the time

What do you guys and girls think?</TEXT>

Basically, mTORC1 stimulation is dependent, like mentioned above, on five elements that relate to nutrient and growth factor availability:

1) the presence of two hormones, insulin and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1);

2) sufficient cellular energy (ATP, which is produced via processing of ingested nutrients from food in the body's main metabolic pathway);

3) the presence of essential branched-chain amino acids (BCAAs), especially leucine

4) the presence of another essential amino acid, glutamine

5) the presence of saturated fatty acids, especially palmitic acid

Now let's look at all five points in relation to dairy and animal proteins and mTORC1 stimulation.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1234_242_22</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

1) Dairy proteins, particularly whole milk, cheese and whey protein, have a much greater insulinemic index than any meat protein, mainly due to the fact that they are hydrolyzed (broken down into molecules by water) much more quickly in the intestine,  thus resulting in a greater insulin and IGF-1 response and therefore greater mTORC1 stimulation as well.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1234_242_23</DOCNO>

2) In order to be activated, the mTORC1 pathway needs ATP, the body's unit of energy.</TEXT>

3) Dairy products contain more leucine.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1234_242_29</DOCNO>

4) Glutamine has a synergistic relationship with leucine, in that it serves as a 'gatekeeper' that ensures leucine uptake by the neural pathway that leads to mTORC1.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1234_242_34</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Some of the foods richest in palmitic acid include oils, fatty meats, cheese and whole milk.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1234_242_35</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>However, the particularity of dairy products such as whole milk is that over 98% of their fat content is made of palmitic acid, making them especially efficient at promoting mTORC1 stimulation.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1234_242_36</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> 

So, to summarize, the two main ways to promote weight loss are, 1) to make the body's fat cells shrink by forcing it to use its own reserves of nutrients, this is mainly achieved by being at a caloric deficit; 2) to limit mTORC1 stimulation; mTORC1 is a protein multicomplex that is ultimately responsible for the production of all bodily tissues, including fat tissue.</TEXT>

One of the many reasons why our society is plagued with obesity and other metabolic diseases is that people are raised without being taught the difference between the need to eat for survival purposes (that is, because you need nutrients in order for your body to produce the energy that it needs to survive), and the need to eat because of an exogenous factor, such as boredom, stress, or peer pressure.</TEXT>

Today's diet looked like this:

Post fasted morning cardio meal:

 640 calorie homemade chocolate pancakes, made with oats, low sodium low fat cottage cheese, chocolate flavoured soybean protein powder, and egg whites

Mid workout meal: 300 calorie protein bar, 30p 30c (10 fibers), 6f

Post-workout meal:

700 calories, extra lean ground chicken, scallops, yam with some spinach and asparagus

Chocolate pancakes using this recipe are definitely one of my favorite foods, it's healthy, tasty and filling.</TEXT>

Whey hydroslate, which is more rapidly absorbed than casein, increases protein synthesis to a greater degree and max protein synthesis occurs within 90mins of ingestion

http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19589961

I don't know of a direct dairy vs meat comparison in muscle (there most likely is one) but most of the data suggest a rapid increases in amino acids results in greater mTOR activation and thus protein synthesis and potentially muscle mass.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> This study is really interesting to me for two reasons:

-Based on previous findings, the researchers had predicted that whey protein would be better at facilitating an increase in muscle mass and a decrease in fat, but this wasn't the case;

-Also based on previous findings, they had predicted that both types would cause a similar increase in satiety-related hypothalamic markers, and they were both correct and wrong: correct because there was a similar increase in both types, but wrong because neither was significant (as you can see [here](http://www.jissn.com/content/12/1/14/figure/F6)), suggesting that protein in general is not effective at initiating a satiety response.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> This study is really interesting to me for two reasons:

-Based on previous findings, the researchers had predicted that whey protein would be better at facilitating an increase in muscle mass and a decrease in fat, but this wasn't the case;

-Also based on previous findings, they had predicted that both types would cause a similar increase in satiety-related hypothalamic markers, and they were both correct and wrong: correct because there was a similar increase in both types, but wrong because neither was significant (as you can see [here](http://www.jissn.com/content/12/1/14/figure/F6)), suggesting that protein in general is not effective at initiating a satiety response beyond the regular calorie consumption response threshold.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> In one particular study, it was found that anabolic steroids such as Testosterone and 19-nortestosterone increase Calcineurin-NFAT signalling, the process by which the protein phosphatase Calcineurin removes the phosphate group from the DNA-binding protein Nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) via hydrolysis, leading to an increase in myoblast cell hypertrophy and a reduction in muscular denervation atrophy, the process by which muscle fibers become shrinked when the nerve to the muscle is severed (1).</TEXT>

In another study, it was found that a lactate-caffeine compound activates 'intracellular calcium signals', which, in turn, also activates calcineurin signalling.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1234_1004_13</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Well, a lot of the original research on leptin came to three conclusions:

1) Morbidly obese people have reduced leptin sensivity

2) Leptin production seems to decrease and increase along with caloric intake

3) Leptin production affects metabolism and appetite

The two latter conclusions were, as usual, widely misunderstood by fitness enthusiasts, and, for the following decades, people would have a discourse along the lines of 'cheating is actually important because it refreshes leptin production' as a result.</TEXT>

A lot of people also say that there are two ways of using steroids: you can either use them to reach your limit genetic potential more quickly, in which case you can maintain your physique without sustained use afterwards, assuming that you keep training and eating properly, OR you can use them to go beyond your genetic limit in terms of muscular tissue, in which case you have to pretty much sustain use in order to stay there.</TEXT>

-An AFK-right click 130 block/min cobblestone generator that can be mined with an Efficiency 5 diamond pickaxe and a Haste II beacon (basic design)

[-A 100% safe 1.8 Wither cage using Barrier blocks (Deactivated End portal frame blocks in a Stronghold can be used for Survival mode)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I07oHxkwV8g)

-[An infinite charcoal producing machine (only works with a constant input of wood logs)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RD1BQAUl134)

[-An auto smelter](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xzbx7vFqqE)

[-2 item sorters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NHjWYCDYJ4s)

Redstonespire, formely from the Zipkrowd, has made a tutorial on how to build a tree log compressor, and his design is pretty much the only one that works reliably and compresses all 4 types of wood (dark oak excluded) without glitches or issues in 1.8.</TEXT>

He explains why he hasn't made a tutorial on how to build the compressor itself or how to connect it with a Wither cage: because, like I said, there is no way to make a reliable design in which the Wither won't have 0.1% chance of breaking out and destroying everything.</TEXT>

In light of evidence, I believe that if Mojang removed the Wither's blue skull attack, it would be beneficial for the community, in that it would allow the player to interact with the Wither a lot more in order to create cool farms and other things.</TEXT>

Based on these two points, my macro and micro nutrient breakdown when I'm cutting usually goes as follows: A) high dietary fiber, B) moderate protein, C) moderate complex carbohydrate, D) low simple carbohydrate, E) moderate good fat (unsaturated, polyunsaturated   omega-3) and as free of bad fat (saturated and trans) as possible, and F) high in vitamins (A, B, C) and minerals (calcium, zinc, phosphorus, etc.).</TEXT>

Here's what the research says on leptin and refeed days:

A) You should increase your caloric intake up to maintenance level (or maybe a little more if you're the 'hard gainer' body type); if you're losing 1lb a week, this is a 500 calorie increase, and more than that is probably not necessarily and might even have negative effects (19);

B) Carbohydrate consumption is associated with an increase in leptin production, but not dietary fat (20) (21);

C) As research has shown (22), an increase in carbohydrate consumption is associated with an increase in insulin levels, which in turn increases the rate at which fat is transported into the body's adipose tissue.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1234_1474_55</DOCNO>

            	<DOCNO>s_1234_1474_56</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Therefore, on refeed days, fat consumption should be kept to minimal amounts;

D) Simple carbohydrates, such as glucose and fructose, have no impact on leptin levels (5).</TEXT>

**Other things to avoid for optimal dieting**

Alcohol: on top of being highly caloric (seven calories per gram) and containing no nutrients, here's why you should avoid drinking for optimal dieting:

A) It disrupts the body's ability to repair and maintain muscle tissue, by slowing down the production of human growth hormone during deep sleep (26).</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1234_1474_58</DOCNO>

B) It slows down metabolism, by disrupting the citric acid cycle, one of the body's main metabolic pathways (27).</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1234_1474_59</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>This is complex, but simply put, alcohol is seen as a poison, and the body prioritizes its oxidation over that of fats, proteins and carbohydrates, which means that less of the macro nutrients you ingest are turned into energy, and inversely, more are turned into stored fat (28).</TEXT>

Last time I went on a 2 week no carb period for my comp prep, I had serious mood issues, and I've realized that it is quite possibly due to electrolyte issues, based on the research I've read and on the fact that that a lot of people who go on ketogenic diets seem to experience the same thing.</TEXT>

I would prefer if my electrolyte supplement was:

-free of carbohydrates (no carb diet)

-free of stimulants (I'm already using Clen HCL for cutting, don't want to get a heart attack)

-particularly high in potassium (same reason as for why I want it free of stims, otherwise I'll just keep buying potassium tablets, but that'd be a nice plus)

Does anyone know of a good electrolyte supplement that meets these requirements?</TEXT>

This is also why ketogenic (fat-based) diets work; in absence of glycolysis, acetyl coA is formed through ketosis, meaning that ketone bodies (beta-Hydroxybutyric acid and acetoacetate) synthesized from fatty acids are used to create energy (ATP) for the body instead.</TEXT>

Based on these two points, my macro and micro nutrient breakdown when I'm cutting usually goes as follows: A) high dietary fiber, B) moderate protein, C) moderate complex carbohydrate, D) low simple carbohydrate, E) moderate good fat (unsaturated, polyunsaturated   omega-3) and as free of bad fat (saturated and trans) as possible, and F) high in vitamins (A, B, C) and minerals (calcium, zinc, phosphorus, etc.).</TEXT>

According to bodybuilder and Nutritional Sciences PhD Layne Norton (9), refeed days should happen every 6 to 12 days, and increasingly more often the longer you have been cutting.</TEXT>

Here's what the research says on leptin and refeed days:

A) You should increase your caloric intake up to maintenance level (or maybe a little more if you're the 'hard gainer' body type); if you're losing 1lb a week, this is a 500 calorie increase, and more than that is probably not necessarily and might even have negative effects (19);

B) Carbohydrate consumption is associated with an increase in leptin production, but not dietary fat (20) (21);

C) As research has shown (22), an increase in carbohydrate consumption is associated with an increase in insulin levels, which in turn increases the rate at which fat is transported into the body's adipose tissue.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1234_1488_54</DOCNO>

            	<DOCNO>s_1234_1488_55</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Therefore, on refeed days, fat consumption should be kept to minimal amounts;

D) Simple carbohydrates, such as glucose and fructose, have no impact on leptin levels (5).</TEXT>

**Other things to avoid for optimal dieting**

Alcohol: on top of being highly caloric (seven calories per gram) and containing no nutrients, here's why you should avoid drinking for optimal dieting:

A) It disrupts the body's ability to repair and maintain muscle tissue, by slowing down the production of human growth hormone during deep sleep (26).</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1234_1488_57</DOCNO>

B) It slows down metabolism, by disrupting the citric acid cycle, one of the body's main metabolic pathways (27).</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1234_1488_58</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>This is complex, but simply put, alcohol is seen as a poison, and the body prioritizes its oxidation over that of fats, proteins and carbohydrates, which means that less of the macro nutrients you ingest are turned into energy, and inversely, more are turned into stored fat (28).</TEXT>

**Why I use carob over chocolate:**

-Carob is naturally sweeter, so less added sugar is needed to get the same sweet taste;

-Carob contains less fat (high carb and high fat do not mix well together, as carbs increase insulin production and insulin production increases adipose tissue uptake of fatty acids);

-Carob has more vitamins and minerals, and less oxalic acid, the latter which can inhibit absorption of certain minerals by the body.</TEXT>

I know that when the TCA occurs, the process of dehydrogenation takes place, which requires the action of the co-enzyme NAD (as it's a redox reaction).</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1234_1499_3</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>I also know that as ethanol is being converted to acetate, the action of NAD is also required, as it gets converted back and forth to NAD and NADH during that process (since it's also a redox reaction).</TEXT>

So, technically, that means that when alcohol enters the liver, there should be an overlap, right?</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1234_1499_6</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Based on logic, that also means alcohol leads to an increase in fat storage, because the TCA transforms fat into energy, and if it does so at a lesser rate because of alcohol (due to NAD co-enzyme overlap), then there is also an increase in adipose uptake of triglycerides as a result (since they aren't used by the body as energy).</TEXT>

However, I could be wrong, but if I understand correctly, it means ingestion of alcohol indirectly results in an increase in fat storage in the body?</TEXT>

Firstly, the idea that it's actually a good thing to have days during which you 'binge eat' even when you're cutting comes from the research on leptin, the mother of all fat burning hormones.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1234_1509_6</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Decreased leptin production is associated with increased appetite and decreased metabolism; when someone has been cutting for a long time, their leptin production is decreased, as leptin production is dependent on caloric intake (2), which is why it becomes increasingly harder to keep losing fat despite being at a daily caloric deficit.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1234_1509_7</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

In order to solve this problem, scientists working with athletes for whom weight is a concern have come up with something known as the 'refeed method', which consists in having days where caloric intake is significantly higher in order to increase leptin production.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1234_1509_8</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>However, those 'refeed days' are not what people on this sub perceive as 'cheat days'; instead, **they are low fat, moderate protein, high carbohydrate days.**</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1234_1509_9</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Here's what the research says on those refeed days:

-You should increase your caloric intake up to maintenance level; if you're losing 1lb a week, this is a 500 calorie increase, and more than that is probably not necessary and might even have negative effects (3).</TEXT>
        </DOC>

            	<DOCNO>s_1234_1509_10</DOCNO>

-Carbohydrate consumption is associated with an increase in leptin production, **but not dietary fat** (4)(5).</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1234_1509_11</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

-As research has shown (6), an increase in carbohydrate consumption is associated with an increase in insulin levels, which in turn increases the rate at which fat is transported into the body's adipose tissue.</TEXT>

Firstly, the idea that it's actually a good thing to have days during which you 'binge eat' even when you're cutting comes from the research on leptin, the mother of all fat burning hormones.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Decreased leptin production is associated with increased appetite and decreased metabolism; when someone has been cutting for a long time, their leptin production is decreased, which is why it becomes increasingly harder to keep losing fat despite being at a daily caloric deficit.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>

In order to solve this problem, scientists working with athletes for whom weight is a concern have come up with something known as the 'refeed method', which consists in having days where caloric intake is significantly higher in order to increase leptin production.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1234_1510_8</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>However, those 'refeed days' are not what people on this sub perceive as 'cheat days'; instead, **they are low fat, moderate protein, high carbohydrate days.**</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1234_1510_9</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Here's what the research says on those refeed days:

-You should increase your caloric intake up to maintenance level (or maybe a little more if you're the 'hard gainer' body type); if you're losing 1lb a week, this is a 500 calorie increase, and more than that is probably not necessarily and might even have negative effects [ (1)](http://diabetes.diabetesjournals.org/content/50/12/2786.abstract);

-Carbohydrate consumption is associated with an increase in leptin production, **but not fat** [(2)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10567012) [(3)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11126336);

-As you can see [here](http://www.spinalhealth.net/insulin.html), an increase in carbohydrate consumption is associated with an increase in insulin levels, which in turn increases the rate at which fat is transported into the body's adipose tissue.</TEXT>

-Simple carbohydrates, such as glucose and fructose, have no impact on leptin levels [(5)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10751202).</TEXT>

In short, here's what I am **NOT saying** but which could easily be interpreted from what I have written:

-that you should justify your THC use as something that will help you eat your face off;

-that you should justify eating your face off as an excuse to eat a caloric surplus.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1234_1520_27</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

What I am **actually saying** is:

-while cutting, you should have periods where you aren't cutting, but instead eating a caloric surplus, such as one day per week or a few meals throughout the week, to make sure that your leptin production stays high.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Basically, it states that certain theories, like people's 'lack of willpower' to eat healthy and an evolutionary mismatch between our current environment and the ability to store food in the face of scarce resources, are not enough to explain food cravings and obesity like it was previously believed.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>

Instead, food cravings are mainly caused by an evolutionary mismatch between people and the bacteria that live in their gut; certain gut bacteria process certain nutrients better, leading to a power-struggle between them in which the dominant bacteria 'hijack' the neural axis between the brain and the gut and, in turn, influence us to eat the food products that contain these nutrients.</TEXT>

 This is an important paradigm shift in our understanding of human eating behaviors, as it suggests that obesity isn't a result of an evolutionary mismatch between the humans and their external environment, but rather, a mismatch between the human body and the beings that live within the environment of which it is itself made.</TEXT>

Frida could have been the real deal, but Grisha ate the f*ck out of her, and then he killed everyone else;

From my understanding, the Coordinate's power seems to be a special version of the Titan's shifter power, and, in order to acquire that power, the user has to become what the reddit community calls a 'mindless Titan' first.</TEXT>

So this is what happens: upon birth, the Reiss girl gets turned into a mindless Titan, and then literally eats her predecessor (the Reiss girl who had the Coordinate's power before her), acquiring both her power and her memories in the process.</TEXT>

However, in case the Reiss girl is, for whatever reason, unable to acquire the Coordinate's power, then there needs to be a ''backup vessel'' that can hold the power until there is a girl from the following generation who is ready.</TEXT>

If you think about it, it has formidable war-related applications:
You can turn enemy soldiers into mindless giant zombies that turn against their own people by trying to eat them;
You can turn your own soldiers into 'war machines' with super-human healing/regenerative capacities and which become vastly stronger upon being wounded;
If your soldiers ever disobey you or become unfit for warfare, you can replace them by having someone else eat them...?;</TEXT>

I think something like this happened: Someone made two variants of the Titan's power, one that neutralizes the enemies by turning them into mindless creatures that will turn against their own people by trying to eat them, and another much more powerful version where the user keeps control of his body and becomes a powerful human weapon.</TEXT>

I could be wrong, but I believe Isayama said in an interview that Eren would learn a 'horrible truth' around volume 15, I believe this is what he is building up to right now and that we're gonna learn about it in chapter 63 or possibly even 62.</TEXT>

Now, as to why Historia is talking so casually with Rod while Eren is in chains on some kind of altar, in my opinion, it's either because Historia has been brainwashed into believing that whatever the hell is going on there is fine, OR, in a plot twist, it's because she's playing along until the Survey Corps shows up.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>One of them somehow developped what we know as the Titan's power, and then made two variants of it: one that would not only render their enemies powerless, but also turn them against their own people, by transforming them into mindless Titans that are programmed to try and 'eat' humans; and another much more powerful variant that would allow them to empower their own people and turn them into weapons of war (aka the Titan-shifters).</TEXT>

 However, later, someone else acquired that Titan's power and turned it against its creator, by altering it so that people who would be turned into mindless Titans would be able to steal a Titan-shifter's power through a process that would involve ingesting his body.</TEXT>

It's still waiting for review, but I've added this part to the 'summary of the story' part of Snk on Wikipedia:

'However, as the story progresses, the plot shifts in focus, being centered more around Historia Reiss, a young girl who is a member of the Survey Cops and whose mysterious royal family is suspected of knowing the truth about both the walls protecting humanity from the Titans and the Titans themselves.'</TEXT>

I'm not sure how to explain this, but if you buy the actual physical copies of the volumes, there is 'hidden' Japanese text at the bottom of the pages.</TEXT>

I'm also not sure if it's a manga or anime spoiler, because it appears in some of the volumes that already have been animated, but here goes:

A long time ago, humanity lived on another continent.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1234_1728_3</DOCNO>

            	<DOCNO>s_1234_1728_4</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Because of this, humanity was severely weakened, and when the Titans started appearing, it was unable to face their overwhelming power.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1234_1728_5</DOCNO>

So the humans decided to leave for another continent.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1234_1728_6</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>It had also been decided that this new continent  would be 'sacred' and 'protected from sin', and so at the time the Walls had already been 'prepared' (not sure about how this word translates) for humanity to that end.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1234_1728_7</DOCNO>

In the end, only the most rich and powerful embarked on the boats that would go to that new continent.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1234_1728_8</DOCNO>

            	<DOCNO>s_1234_1728_9</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Soon, however, the Titans started appearing on the new continent as well, and it was decided that humanity would never leave the walls again to protect itself.</TEXT>

My own interpretation: Based on this, the world within the Walls was made as big one lie, as a dream world where the outside world doesn't exist and those in power lie about it.</TEXT>
