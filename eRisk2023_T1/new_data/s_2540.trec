To clarify my point, my issue with Vertigo's canonization isn't that the polls were counted improperly: I simply don't understand what any of these individuals were thinking when they selected it, and I  disagree with the collective result on those grounds.</TEXT>

Finally, to argue against the existence of greatness is to argue against the whole process of creating a film canon, which doesn't intrinsically disagree with my premise: if nothing deserves canonical recognition, then Vertigo doesn't either--but that strikes me as a bit of a departure from the topic at hand either way.</TEXT>

Better go down upon your marrow-bones

And scrub a kitchen pavement, or break stones

Like an old pauper, in all kinds of weather;

Is to work harder than all these, and yet

Be thought an idler by the noisy set

Of bankers, schoolmasters, and clergymen

The martyrs call the world.'</TEXT>

About the stars and broke in days and years.</TEXT>

As weary-hearted as that hollow moon.</TEXT>

 On a less positive note, its deeply frustrating that, while its central and supporting male characters are flawed and complex characters, with a few extremely minor exceptions (such as the aforementioned optional getaway driver), GTA V has little room for women except to portray them as strippers, prostitutes, long-suffering wives, humorless girlfriends and goofy, new-age feminists were meant to laugh at.</TEXT>
