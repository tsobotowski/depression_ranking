I do agree BOTRK is a stronger item but is a lot more expensive and by hitting the power spike of FF and WE by the 17 minute mark or so I think it helps out a lot more for the early to mid game.</TEXT>

Also another quick note if you don't already do this is to start with a pink and save your 50 remaining gold for your first back don't waste it on a hp pot at the start its really not needed on ww.</TEXT>
