If you have look at [this graph of temperature](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Holocene_Temperature_Variations.png), starting at a point when we were finishing the climb out of deep glaciation, you can clearly see that rapid warming ceased around 10,000 years ago (rapid relative to natural fluctuations, but not compared to the warming today, which is an order of magnitude faster).</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> Many men experience a less powerful urinary stream when emptying the bladder, as they get older.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>

It is estimated that something like 1 in 3 men over the age of 50 develop urinary outflow symptoms, which in the majority of cases is due to benign enlargement of the prostate gland, otherwise known as benign prostatic hyperplasia.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_433_33_2</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

The gland gradually enlarges as the years go by, and this enlargement can cause pressure on the water pipe which runs from the bladder to the outside (the urethra), restricting the flow of urine in just the same way that water running through a hose is restricted if the hose is kinked or compressed.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_433_33_3</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Another cause of urinary flow restriction is a stricture in the urethra as a result of inflammatory scarring, perhaps as a result of a previous infection or operative catheterization.</TEXT>

My advice would be to go along and see your GP so that an examination of your prostate gland may take place.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_433_33_5</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Initially, examination with a gloved finger can determine whether the gland is physically enlarged, and a blood test known as a PSA (prostate specific antigen) can measure a chemical secreted by the prostate gland to ensure that any enlargement is benign.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_433_33_6</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

If necessary, a rectal ultrasound test can be organized to further examine the interior of the gland non-invasively.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_433_33_7</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

I strongly advise you not to delay seeking help, as there is much evidence that early treatment with medication can prevent the problem from becoming worse, and often delays the need for surgery in years to come.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_433_33_8</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

At any rate, if you have noticed symptoms your prostate gland should be examined because prostate cancer, although an unlikely possibility in your case, is very much on the increase and is potentially very serious even in relatively young men like yourself.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_433_54_2</DOCNO>

The relevance of the theorem is questionablethe probability of a universe full of monkeys typing a complete work such as Shakespeare's Hamlet is so tiny that the chance of it occurring during a period of time hundreds of thousands of orders of magnitude longer than the age of the universe is extremely low (but technically not zero).</TEXT>

I'll repeat, as of 1995, according to the [US Census Bureau, 50% of people who identified as indigenous preferred the term American Indian, 37% preferred Native American, and the remainder preferred other terms or had no preference.](http://www.census.gov/prod/2/gen/96arc/ivatuck.pdf) You may well have met all 37% of the total number of native peoples who prefer "Native American," and that's dandy, but it does not argue my point that the term "Indian" is not offensive to most Indians.</TEXT>

So Black Panther has a movie pending, Storm is only featured alongside the X-Men, Spawn had a movie, the only Green Lantern you can expect to see is Hal, Static had a cartoon but don't hold your breath for a movie, Mr. Terrific is relatively unknown and won't get a movie, people are already bitching about Cyborg's inclusion in the Justice League movie, Steel had a shitty movie and is just a Superman knockoff anyway, Blade had the trilogy that kicked off the comic book movie boom, Vixen is getting an animated series, Icon   Rocket are relative unknowns and won't get a movie but were featured in Young Justice, Hardware is unknown and won't get a movie, Bronze Tiger   Black Spider are borderline heroes but Bronze Tiger is in the CW Version of the Suicide Squad and both might be featured in a Suicide Squad movie sequel if the first one is successful, Luke Cage might appear in a Marvel TV series, War Machine has had multiple movie appearances but it's just the Iron Man knockoff, Falcon has appeared in a limited sidekick role, Bishop was briefly in an X-Men movie, Night Thrasher and Cloak may make appearances in a Marvel TV series.</TEXT>

Here's a quote from the [first one](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2006-23323-000): Anderson, Gentile, and Buckley describe the reaction of the games industry to scientific findings that exposure to violent video games and other forms of media violence constitutes a significant risk factor for later aggressive and violent behavior.</TEXT>

Here's a more [recent one from 2015](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876285914003325): Child-reported media violence exposure was associated with physical aggression after multivariable adjustment for sociodemographics, family and community violence, and child mental health symptoms (partial correlation coefficients: TV, 0.17; video games, 0.15; music, 0.14).</TEXT>

Here's another [recent study](http://scan.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2015/03/09/scan.nsv025.abstract): Media violence exposure causes increased aggression and decreased prosocial behavior, suggesting that media violence desensitizes people to the emotional experience of others.</TEXT>

[From Wikipedia:](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_war_crimes#Crimes)

According to the findings of the Tokyo Tribunal, the death rate among POWs from Asian countries, held by Japan was 27.1%.[40] The death rate of Chinese POWs was much higher becauseunder a directive ratified on August 5, 1937 by Emperor Hirohitothe constraints of international law on treatment of those prisoners was removed.[41] Only 56 Chinese POWs were released after the surrender of Japan.[42] After March 20, 1943, the Japanese Navy was under orders to execute all prisoners taken at sea.[43] Around 1,536 U.S. civilians were killed or otherwise died of abuse and mistreatment in Japanese internment camps in the Far East; by comparison, 883 U.S. civilians died in German internment camps in Europe.[44]</TEXT>

Dear Christopher,

 

Knowing your concern regarding the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA), I wanted to take this opportunity to update you on my position regarding this legislation.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_433_1923_2</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> I have appreciated having the benefit of your thoughts on this important issue.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_433_1923_3</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

 

H.R. 3261, the Stop Online Piracy Act was introduced by Rep. Lamar Smith (R-TX) on October 26, 2011.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_433_1923_4</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> It has been referred to the House Judiciary Committee.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_433_1923_5</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>The primary purpose of SOPA is to stop the theft of intellectual property from foreign-based websites.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_433_1923_6</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

 

Although well intentioned, many have raised legitimate concerns regarding the legislation and believe the manner in which SOPA attempts to achieve its goals of stopping the theft of intellectual property from foreign-based websites is unworkable and includes many unintended and dangerous consequences.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_433_1923_7</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>I am writing today to inform you that I have severe reservations with the legislation in its current form.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_433_1923_8</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

One of the main issues regarding SOPA, is it would force Internet Service Providers (ISPs) to block access to websites that have been accused of facilitating copyright infringement.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_433_1923_9</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> Blocking access will likely slow down internet connectivity, while eroding the necessary trust the system needs.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_433_1923_10</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>It would also set a dangerous precedent of allowing our government  and others  to filter domains.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_433_1923_11</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Fortunately, all sides have signaled this provision should be dropped.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_433_1923_12</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Furthermore, the legislation would place a tremendous legal burden on websites accused of third-party copyright infringement and would cause them to be removed from search engines.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_433_1923_13</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> Even if they made an honest mistake, they would be faced with litigation from the U.S. Attorney General.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_433_1923_14</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Fighting the accusations would cost an enormous amount of time and money, and smaller sites would likely go out of business.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_433_1923_15</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Private lawsuits could also be brought against the websites.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_433_1923_16</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>This would open up the potential for massive lawsuit abuse  even though the vast majority of online piracy occurs through a small number of websites.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_433_1923_17</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

While the federal government does have a role in protecting intellectual property rights, it should do so in a way that does not weaken internet security, disrupt growth, or restrict free speech and your First Amendment rights.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_433_1923_18</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

As the debate on this legislation continues, I look forward to working with my colleagues in the House of Representatives to ensure the needs of copyright protection are balanced with the First Amendment Rights of all Americans.</TEXT>
