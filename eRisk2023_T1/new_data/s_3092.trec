In other words, its impossible to reconcile subjectivity with one objective view of the world: if you were to say to someone who recently broke "love is just a bunch of chemicals that came from evolution - your relationship means absolutely nothing because its just a bunch of chemicals really" you would probably get punched because from their perspective, those chemicals are just a byproduct of something with meaning that only they can understand.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Sure, the queen doesn't abuse the powers she technically has, but having an unelected representative holding the highest office of state without having a single vote casted on her name is fundamentally wrong... so goes the Republican argument 

I'm no republican though and the point people seemed to miss is that this instills a healthy deal of determinism in us brits, which I think explains why recognize, say the injustice of tax cuts for the wealthiest members of society at a time of austerity unlike our cousins on the other side of the Atlantic.</TEXT>
