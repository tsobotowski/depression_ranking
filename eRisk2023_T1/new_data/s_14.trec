Unlike simple models such as disease contagion or transmission of news, which need only one exposure to infect or inform the next individual, the spreading of protests is more complex, making it less certain, said Steinert-Threlkeld, who teaches courses on these topics at the undergraduate and graduate levels at UCLA Luskin.</TEXT>

The research team identified four key findings from the study:

Violent media use was positively and significantly related to aggressive behavior in all countries
Exposure was related to heightened aggressive thinking and lowered empathy
Media violence remained significant even after controlling for other risk factors
The effect of media violence was larger than all other risk factors, except peer delinquency
This is strong evidence that the main psychological processes that cause repeated media violence exposure to lead to increased aggressiveness are essentially the same across cultures, at least during normal times, said study leader Craig Anderson, an ISU distinguished professor of psychology.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_14_323_7</DOCNO>

However, we believe that local cultural and social conditions may influence such processes when those conditions are more extreme.</TEXT>

Anderson went on to explain that in war-torn societies, media violence exposure may have heightened effects due to the real violence children and teens experience on a daily basis.</TEXT>

In addition to measuring media violence, the research team looked at five other risk factors of aggressive behavior: neighborhood crime, peer delinquency, peer victimization, gender, and abusive parenting.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_14_323_11</DOCNO>

Combined, these factors significantly predicted aggressive behavior and as a group were more powerful than any individual factor.</TEXT>

Below are the six major risk factors of aggressive behavior and how each contributes to overall risk:

Peer delinquency  28 percent
Media violence  23 percent
Peer victimization  17 percent
Gender  12 percent
Neighborhood crime  11 percent
Abusive parenting  nine percent
The findings strongly suggest that media violence is similar to other known risk factors for aggression, said Douglas Gentile, an ISU professor of psychology and one of the co-authors.</TEXT>

Hormonal contraceptives, like birth control pills, implantable rods and patches, contain two types of hormones: estrogen, which naturally peaks just before ovulation when naturally cycling women can conceive offspring, and hormones that have the same effect as progesterone, which naturally peaks during the extended sexual phase, a time when offspring cannot be conceived.</TEXT>
