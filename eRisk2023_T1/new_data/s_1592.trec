            	<TEXT>Well tbh on valentine's Day it's Sunday for me.... So hopefully thats lucky for me..... It decreases the chances of that happening since half of in the uni won't come since they don't live in dorms.... The only guy I can think of is one that she was hanging out once... I have only seen her twice in uni once with her friends and once with a guy... If anything that guy might confess.. but that's alright if she already has someone she likes I can't really do anything about it....</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>I was really scared tbh like I did try to ask her out yesterday as well I couldn't do it because of my confidence so I never walked up to her, I have never done this before... I m socially awkward so I don't really know how to even talk to a normal person even if it's a guy... I m kinda happy that I pulled out this much confidence at that time.... I didn't knew I had that much confidence to go talk to a girl that I know nothing about and try to ask her out... Even tho I was rejected somehow that didn't bother me much since I learned a lot from it... At first I thought that doing this might fuck up my mental state... But I kinda feel more confident now.... I m gonna try to improve my social skills now so and practice talking to random ppl more.... Tho I didn't plan anything so I fucked up what I said since I don't know how to start convos... And I think I scared her a little that's why she did that..</TEXT>
