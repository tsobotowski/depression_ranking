They'd amount to being minor bonuses - +5 hp here, +7 magicka there, +3 block, etc that would serve more to provide flavor to the character without making it wildly powerful - there's not a massive difference between 25 and 30 for most skills in terms of long-term benefit ( and before legendary was introduced, actually would *lower your max level* ), but it lets you play as a Khajit who is slightly better at using his claws in combat, an Orc who is in great shape and has higher than normal health, an Argonian that is good at using a shield and conjuring weapons to fight with, a Nord comes from a line of Speakers and has stronger than usual Thu'um, or a particularly superstitious Breton who has slight magic resistance ( stacking a magic and religion trait to get it ).</TEXT>

In the grand scheme, a half-way decent enchanting score would make most if not all of these useless unless you do "flat-or-percentile-whichever-is-more" scripted stuff, so I don't feel any bonus would be too strong as long as it is kept at 10 or lower.</TEXT>
