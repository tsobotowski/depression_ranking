Video file video quality though is measured in megabits per second and a 4k HDR netflix video stream is 25 megabits per second but with their new video encoder tech they are able to make H.265 HVEC video in 4k HDR go as low as 5mbps when there is no action on the screen.</TEXT>

To put that into context a UHD Bluray uses 28 to 50 mbps for H.265 video 

also my torrents typically only go 1.2 to 5 megabits per second but i throttle though typically to have it only go max 1mbps upload and 2mbps download with 6 downloads at a time and 30 uploads at a time.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>If you want to know why, Here goes

1) Trump owes Blackstone/ Bayrock group $560 million dollars (one of his largest debtors and the primary reason he won't reveal his tax returns)

2) Blackstone is owned wholly by Russian billionaires, who owe their position to Putin and have made billions from their work with the Russian government.</TEXT>

5) Russia has an impetus to influence our election to ensure the per barrel oil prices are above $65 ( they are currently hovering around $50)

6) Russia can't affordably get at 80% of its oil reserves and reduce its per barrel cost to compete with America at $45 or Saudi Arabia at $39.</TEXT>

7) Rex Tillerson (Trump's pick for Secretary of State) is the head of ExxonMobil, which is in possession of patented technology that could help Putin extract 45% more oil at a significant cost savings to Russia, helping Putin put money in the Russian coffers to help reconstitute its military and finally afford to mass produce the new and improved systems that it had invented before the Russian economy had slowed so much.</TEXT>

9) Look for Trump to end sanctions on Russia and to back out of the Iranian nuclear deal, to help Russia rebuild its economy, strengthen Putin and make Tillerson and Trump even richer, thus allowing Trump to satisfy his creditors at Blackstone.</TEXT>

-----***EDIT****---


Found it my self I can't believe i fucked this up I knew who did it all the time It was DJ Shadow Organ Donor

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4E60Ffa9yQ

The reason i had it stuck in my head is because I heard Dizzee Rascal - Fix Up, Look Sharp

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4B06gdaXJeY

Which got me to remember this song which was from Dj Hero

Fix Up Look Sharp vs Organ Donor - Dizzee Rascal vs Dj Shadow

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AAUmDMMgYGY

This then had me hunting for the original song which I thought was DJ Shadow but i couldn't remember because cognitive dissidence caused by the ear worm and other music.</TEXT>

**According to the Department of Labor, an unpaid internship must meet all these criteria:**

- The internship is similar to training which would be given in an educational environment.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_405_1444_9</DOCNO>

 Write a complete C/Java program to add two very large numbers together as follows:
 Enter the first number
 1999999999999999999999999999999999999999999996667766999999

 Enter the second number
 888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888888

       10000.00   12312.00   13212.00   12312.00   12312.00
