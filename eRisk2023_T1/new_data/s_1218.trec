This suggests language affects the way people perceive color: http://cdp.sagepub.com/content/13/3/95.short

This is more of a neuroscience based article on brain activation in an MRI while people are looking at colors in their right and left visual fields: http://www.pnas.org/content/106/20/8140.full

This looks at language-specific terminology and color perception: http://www.pnas.org/content/106/11/4567.full
