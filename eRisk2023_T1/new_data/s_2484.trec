Alternatives:
Complicated, depends on your cause and the type of pain (nerve, bony, muscle pain)... for some diet, weight loss and exercise, for some its anti depressants (for nerve pain old school one like amytriptyline), for some it's surgery, and others it's nsaids and time...

His campaign advisor was tied to Russian intervention in Ukraine, his  security advisor was talking to the Russians about sanctions and lied about consulting fees he was paid before in violation of the emoioemenrs clause, his attorney general who prosecute any malfeasance lied about speaking to the Russians, possibly Russian intelligence leaked his oppositions internal emails... 

Maybe you don't buy the msm narrative... but why is it somehow assumed trump and his people aren't involved in something nefarious...

If this sub is truly about transparency, freedom, civil liberties, the truth then one would expect people to demand a special prosecutor, trump to open up his business dealings, and further investigation....

At this point it's going to be a more pertinent question of who in trumps cabinet is not speaking to the Russians or met with their ambassador and who hasn't been paid by them.</TEXT>

And while this phrase, coined about eichman, missed eichman's chillingly unrepentant sociopathy, it is a useful way of understanding that a relatively modern western nation, through the exploitation of existing racial biasis and divisions, nationalism, propaganda, with some facilitating socio-economic factors, can become a machine which conducts the slaughter of their own and neighboring peoples on an industrial scale.</TEXT>

To pretend that the german soldiers were some average joes protecting their homes misses the point... a point that should be a sobering reminder about the dangers of unchecked propaganda, flaming sectarian and racial divides, and dismantling the institutions of government/democracy/free press etc...

 The problem and disconnect you see with parties is they say one thing and then cherry pick data to support that argument and then the results don't help those that they were supposed to help and hurt others while benefiting a third party...

The problem there is multi-factered but at the end of the day these parties, while ideological, are not stupid and simply tell the electorate one thing, manipulate science to support the proposal and claim, but in practice the policy was really never meant to help the electorate and is to the benefit of either a religious, ideological, corporate or socioeconomic segment of society.</TEXT>
