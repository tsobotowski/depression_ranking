When I do makeup on other people, I realized the thing that gave me the most trouble is doing their liner, especially wings, which I have a feeling you are going to be making use of.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_664_172_4</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>I suggest that you have them look straight on at you, and you draw the wing first, so that you can draw a wing that is appropriate for the type of eye they have, otherwise it could look a bit cartoonish or just flat-out ridiculous.</TEXT>
