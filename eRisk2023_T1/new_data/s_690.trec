Quote from [Justice Joseph Story written in his Commentaries on the Constitution in 1833](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/watergatedoc_3.htm) about how Impeachment applies to offenses of "a political character":

 "Not but that crimes of a strictly legal character fall within the scope of the power; but that it has a more enlarged operation, and reaches, what are aptly termed political offenses, growing out of personal misconduct or gross neglect, or usurpation, or habitual disregard of the public interests, various in their character, and so indefinable in their actual involutions, that it is almost impossible to provide systematically for them by positive law They must be examined upon very broad and comprehensive principles of public policy and duty.</TEXT>

 Impeachment, as Justice Joseph Story wrote in his Commentaries on the Constitution in 1833, applies to offenses of "a political character":  
  
 "Not but that crimes of a strictly legal character fall within the scope of the power; but that it has a more enlarged operation, and reaches, what are aptly termed political offenses, growing out of personal misconduct or gross neglect, or usurpation, or habitual disregard of the public interests, various in their character, and so indefinable in their actual involutions, that it is almost impossible to provide systematically for them by positive law They must be examined upon very broad and comprehensive principles of public policy and duty.</TEXT>

EDIT: Looks like whether or not to even notify [targets of prosecution](http://www.instituteforlegalreform.com/uploads/sites/1/DeclinationsBooklet.pdf) that they are no longer being investigated is discretionary, and the [US Attorney manual] (https://www.justice.gov/usam/usam-9-2000-authority-us-attorney-criminal-division-mattersprior-approvals#9-2.050) doesn't say much about publicly disclosing, just filing a written notice in 'cases of considerable public interest'
