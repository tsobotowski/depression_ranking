Excerpts from the song dealing with bullets

"Hand in mine into your icy blues,
and then i say to you,
We can take to the highway 
With this trunk of ammunition, too
I'd end my days with you
In a hail of bullets"

"All we are, all we are, is bullets I mean this
All we are, all we are, is bullets I mean this
All we are, all we are, is bullets I mean this
All we are, all we are, is bullets I mean this,
 
As lead rains, will pass on through our phantoms
Forever, forever
Like scarecrows that fuel this flame we're burning
Forever, and ever
Know how much I want to show you you're the only one
Like a bed of roses there's a dozen reasons in this gun

And as we're falling down, and in this pool of blood
And as we're touching hands, and as we're falling down
And in this pool of blood, and as we're falling down
I'll see your eyes, and in this pool of blood
I'll meet your eyes, I mean this forever"

i want to be happy with her

i can't shake the feeling that he is going to keep trying to do things with her, and eventually she will start to like it, and eventually she will like him, and knowing that she chose someone else again, knowing that i wasn't good enough again, knowing that i'll never have a chance with her- that will hurt.</TEXT>

matters of the heart are impossible

you can't do anything to fucking change them

when he's not around her it's fine, i wait, im patient, im calm

but i know no one ever chooses me

ever

if there s compettion im going to be passe dup

because im never good enough

i feel sick sometimes, i feel fineothers, i feel beyond confident sometimes, if eel like trash others

tonight i feel sick and like trash

i'm not always this way

but when i am it makes it so much harder to feel okay again and to be myself again

because even when i am happy i feel like i just want to be loved
