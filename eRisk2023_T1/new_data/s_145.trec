Honestly the female characters in this show end up being the most important characters in it.</TEXT>

Edit: my eyes are hazel, my skin tone is pale/milky white, my hair is a light copper color, my brows are light like my hair, and my price range is reasonable...I can't afford to pay $200 to have a a starting amount of make up...
