        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_55_1079_6</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>So how I went about that was: prime it base coat it with maccraig blue (Im not sure what blue you went with here) then dry brush it with a lighter blue like calgar blue then I would wash the entire model with nuln oil, let that dry and do a light dry brush with a lighter blue like lothern blue but only on downwards motions so it gives that brighter on top darker underneath and then go onto your golds and all the detail pieces and it will make a huge difference.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>To be honest with you (to make you feel a little better) my surgery was an accumulation of injuries over a long period of time I started with a torn acl and mcl back in 2006, back then the acl and mcl were separate surgeries so I opted to go with the mcl so I opted to go with the mcl so I could get back to sports faster and I just wore an acl brace and I just ended up leaving the torn acl because of the recovery time and it slowly got worse and worse untill not this summer that just passed the summer before.</TEXT>
