a few things about the gameplay that you might not like

potions can't be drunk during combat you have to drink them beforehand (this includes potions like swallow)

no climbing or jumping down unless there is a certain spot the game allows it

            	<TEXT> so many people don't want these changes but guess what the biggest complaints about f1 are slow cars, less noise etc etc

a lot of fans has been driven away from the sport these changes will hopefully bring them back and attract new ones

you can't keep it the way it is especially when track attendance and tv audiences are dropping it's the whole reason they had this meeting in the first place</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> the entire reason they are bringing this back is a LOT of fans miss the spectacle that f1 used to be

you may think it's for 8 year olds but clearly a lot of people have been driven away from the sport due to the slower cars and less noise or they wouldn't be having this meeting to change the sport

getting those fans back and attracting news one will keep the sport alive not keeping it the way it is and have track attendance and tv audiences die off anymore then it currently is</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> it was boring and a sign of how the rest of the year will be

some teams are struggling to even finish a race.. Rosberg doesn't have what it takes to challenge Hamilton, the Ferrari's have improved but not enough to pose a threat to the Mercedes and we have yet to see a good vettel kimi battle because something always fucks it

williams not good enough to keep up with the ferrari so we can expect the same results each race 1.hamilton 2 rosberg 3 vettel 4 kimi 5-6 bottas/massa

i think they increased it because it's 50 ISO-8 but it's hard to achieve
i wouldn't mind if it was less ISO-8 so more people could actually have a chance to earn it</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> i hate the rank up system in the game and have been playing nothing but events lately because i've hit a road block needing a level 35 spiderman to continue.. 

even that sucks because there is a few people with level 90 spiderman that i have no chance to match their scores of 1-3 million with my level 30 spiderman with a much lower score multiplier 

game is massively geared to get you to pay for iso-8 for instant rank up or to get the right premium spiderman to continue</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> downloaded it the other day it was fun at first but when you get up to the missions that require a level 35 spiderman the game gets ridiculous

the amount of iso-8 you need to level up is ridiculous and you got to be lucky to get 4-5 of the same premium card and another 2 to level them up

obviously geared to get people to pay otherwise it would take months to even get enough (other endless runner games aren't this bad)

takes away from the fun of the game when you hit a roadblock like this
