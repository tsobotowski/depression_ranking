            	<TEXT>This is a problem though, as a core your early game HAS to go great also because your farming ability is poor, I'd say you have the same chances of having a good early game as a support Undying than you do as a core because a lot of it is reliant on Tombstone's effectiveness (which needs slows / stuns from the rest of your team unless you catch heroes being way too aggressive) - at least playing support in a dual lane can get you more reliable levels than going solo against a harass heavy dual or tri lane (if it's an easy solo lane then most offlaners would be able to snowball from this and I'd prefer that'd be a Bristleback, Centaur or Void over an Undying).</TEXT>
