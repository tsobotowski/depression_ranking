            	<TEXT> Not sure what "it can sometimes" refers to in your comment, but as for the rest, consider these points:

* The order of names in the credits was contractually predetermined before the movie even began shooting, so nothing you or anyone else says about the poster will ever take precedent over that order

*  On the other hand, since the order is determined in advance, the artist creating a poster probably views the names as just another legal line, same as the blocks of credits that appear on the bottom.</TEXT>

* This poster will be turned into tons of various formats including web banners where the names might me too small to read, or billboards next to highways, where even if the names are big enough, you won't have enough time to read them when you drive by.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_2156_571_4</DOCNO>

            	<TEXT>

Overall: I think the lack of happy endings might be caused by:

* the fact that some of these movies aimed to be realistic and real life rarely has happy endings

* the stereotypical Hollywood happy ending is actually lazy and escapist and serious filmmakers are doing something more interesting</TEXT>

* either the book isn't very good to begin with and Affleck should have either changed things or just not adapt it at all,

Regardless of whether the book has the same problems as the film or not, it's still not a good film and things could have been done to fix that.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> Basically, a good non-spoilery, ambiguous trailer does at least one of these things:

- little to no dialogue from the movie (Girl With a Dragon Tattoo, The Force Awakens, Interstellar)

- either just one extended scene that pulls you in (American Sniper) or many inter-cut images that engage your attention (Girl With a Dragon Tattoo, Gone Girl, The Handmaiden)

- memorable, standout music, which is either a song (Girl With a Dragon Tattoo, Gone Girl, ) or the actual score from the movie (The Force Awakens)

- images that set the mood but are not actually from the movie (Alien, Interstellar)

JP3 takes the Aliens route of being much more action packed and showing much more of the dinosaurs than its predecessors and basically becomes an action movie instead of an adventure movie (similarly to how Cameron switched genres from monster horror to action and showed us all those aliens instead of keeping them scary and in the dark).</TEXT>
