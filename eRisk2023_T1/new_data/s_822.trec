Been seeing a lot of discussion in the community recently about how all four of the above champions have extremely powerful kits that cause them to dominate the meta and crowd out other champs in their roles if their numbers are even remotely decent (and often refuse to fall off even when they're nerfed because of the utility of their kits) and it made me think "huh weren't they all released in 2014" and then I realised all four were released within months of each other.</TEXT>

Also, aware that people might just try to play the majority of their final 25 games in the season solo to avoid getting a dynamic border but if the player is truly boosted and doesn't belong at that level they will drop in elo over 25 games so it'll still be a more accurate mark of their solo ranking.</TEXT>

Going into the new champ select, Riot decided to give the bans to the last three picks (3, 4, 5) with the intention of making champ select fairer but thinking about it, with how roles are now going to be decided before anyone even enters champ select there's no longer going to be much advantage to being an early pick in ranked - first pick no longer gives you the benefit of role selection (as you'd have already chosen your role) or bans and instead the earlier you pick the more likely you're forced to blind pick your matchup and are going to end up getting countered.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> Oh, yeah I wasn't trying to rush to any conclusions, by 'has the cards' I meant he has all the attributes of a solid top laner (not afraid to go for plays when he sees the opportunity, good laner (showing good lane mechanics vs Acorn/Flame individually have little to do with LGD as a team), not reckless, good map awareness and teamplayer) which if he keeps it up, has the potential to hold up internationally.</TEXT>
