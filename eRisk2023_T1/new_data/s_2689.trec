Outside of the required classes for my literature class two years ago, I've read:

* Hunger Games Trilogy

* Ready Player One (Armada looks interesting)

* Homeland by Cory Doctrow (I didn't like the ending)

* Ender's Game

* Speaker for the Dead

I tried to get into Xenocide, but the shift from Portugese to Chinese is jarring.</TEXT>

Thankfully, the game doesn't require an instantaneous jump from i50 to i90 as the 3 main raids (LOTA, ST, WoD) are (i50, i70, i90 respectively)

I'd say about 20-30 hours of gameplay. (</TEXT>

----

Hours of anime per season (aniHour): (35 shows * 12 episodes * 23.5 minutes)/60 minutes = 164.5

Hours of anime per year (aniYear): aniHour * 4 = 658

Hours per year, including leap day: 8766

Approximate years that anime has been solidly running: 40

Total hours of anime so far (airedHours): aniYear * 40 = 26320 hours

Days to finish all anime (without catching up with currently airing) (curAirTime): airedHours / 24 = ~1098 (3.006 years or ~ 3 years and 2 days)

Hours of anime aired during completion (compCatch): 3.006 * aniYear = ~3952 hours

Completing that set: (compCatch / 24) = ~165 days

\# of Seasons while completing set #1: 165/(365.25/4) = 1.80698

Time to complete set #2: 1.80698*658 = ~1200 hours (50 days)

Catching up again: 50/(365.25/4) = 0.5475 seasons * aniHour = 360 hours (~15 days)

Catching up #4: ((15/(365.25/4)) * aniHour) = 108.09 hours (~4.5 days)

---

TL;DM: **3 years and 221.5 days (31596 hours)** of non-stop anime watching to catch up to what has and will be aired.</TEXT>

So far, I own the soundtracks to:

* Clannad
* Little Busters
* Angel Beats
* Girls und Panzer

I'm looking to get, sometime in the near future:

* Cowboy Bebop (All three soundtracks)
* Sora no Woto
* Suzumiya Haruhi no Gensou (This is the live orchestral performance of the OST and some insert songs)

Amazon.co.jp charges ~$12 per shipment overseas and $2-3 per item so I'm trying to save on shipping.</TEXT>

It is a video hosting site, much like YouTube and Vimeo, but they have partners such as MTV, Xbox, MSN, Yahoo, etc.. As such they are paying users to submit their videos for them to then use on and with these partners.</TEXT>

Wii U games I am looking at getting: 

* New Zelda (The one to be announced at E3)
* New Super Mario/Luigi Bros U (Comes with the bundle)
* Super Mario 3D World
* Mario Kart 8
* Super Smash Bros for Wii U
* The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker HD (Free w/ MK8)
* Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze

With the MK8 Promotion, it has lessened the time that I have to make a decision as the free game helps.</TEXT>
