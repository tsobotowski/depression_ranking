So, I put blackout curtains on the bathroom windows, pinned another to the ceiling next to the little alcove where the bathtub sits recessed into the wall, and stuffed black towels under the gap between the bathroom door and the tile floor.</TEXT>

The sound of blood whispering through the vessels in my body...

Water rippling against the sides of the tub... 

Someone breathing....

Wait.</TEXT>

At the exact moment my brain processed that there was an extra set of lungs breathing somewhere near me, a rush of chill air ruffled the curtains I'd hung up around the tub, and the water in which I sat went from being near-scalding hot to feeling as though someone had dumped buckets of ice into it.</TEXT>

I'd stupidly brought it into the bathroom with me, and it was sitting tucked between the blackout curtain and the shower liner, probably propped against the outside of the tub.</TEXT>

Just looking at it, at level 1 it's already most of the way toward being as good as my lvl 13 stock Tomcat-A. 
Should be a fun plane to fly in; the question is, do I shelve my stock A model in pursuit of buffing out the Chopper-A, or do I stick with my standard?</TEXT>

If you think I'm kidding on the second part, consult the UCMJ that governs the real world U.S. Military and you'll see that any soldier, sailor, airman, or marine that inflicts bodily damage upon themselves, whether intentionally or unintentionally, can actually be tried and punished under UCMJ laws.</TEXT>
