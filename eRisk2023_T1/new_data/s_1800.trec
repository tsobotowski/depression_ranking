 Cause according to my Google search it's state run media and Syrian officials who are putting out that information: https://www.wsj.com/articles/syrian-media-say-u-s-attack-caused-damage-to-air-base-multiple-casualties-1491535071

 Looking into your post history you even posted an artlcle on this sub that states that the information came from the Syrian army here: http://www.france24.com/en/20170407-usa-strikes-syria-base-with-cruise-missiles-trump-gas-attack

 So why the are stating to me that it came from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights when you know in fact that it didn't?</TEXT>
