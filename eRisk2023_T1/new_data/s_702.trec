It is mainly due to [this issue I had with them.](http://www.reddit.com/r/electronic_cigarette/comments/2m5km4/horrible_customer_experience_with_eciggity/)

It's also because I feel that they participate in vote manipulation on reddit, both on comments made by their official account and on posts relative to their company.</TEXT>

I know for sure that the handbrake lever in the car was down all the way, but I don't know for certain that something wasn't pulling the handbrake mechanism on the caliper, as I've made some adjustments in the way the cables connect to the lever (cables kept falling out of the bracket, couldn't get it tight, just duct tape wrapped them).</TEXT>

 You are my first,

I can barely breathe

I find you fascinating

You are my favorite,

Lay you down to sleep

It's all that I can do to stop... love...

So blue, so broken,

Paper doll decays

I haven't left you yet

So cold, subversive,

Your eyes are full of bleach

Tomorrow I will go away again... love...

YOU ARE MINE, YOU WILL ALWAYS BE MINE,

I CAN TEAR YOU APART

I CAN RECOMBINE YOU

ALL I WANT IS TO COVET YOU ALL

YOU BELONG TO ME

I WILL KILL YOU TO LOVE YOU (LOVE).</TEXT>

It is sized by mm.x.mm

0.4x0.1 = 32 gauge

0.5x0.1 = 31 gauge

0.6x0.1 = 30 gauge

0.7x0.1 = 29 gauge

0.8x0.1 = 28 gauge

0.9x0.1 = 27 gauge

What you want to do to find what is right for you is head over to [Steam Engine](http://www.steam-engine.org/coil.asp), under Material and Profile, select Kanthal A1 Ribbon, under Setup, select how many coils you usually rock, select your usual goal resistance, and your usual coil diameter.</TEXT>

Eciggity, 
I contacted you on 11/1 when I got my EHPRO Veritas in the mail, order #30021 (https://eciggity.zendesk.com/requests/30021), saying that it was shipped full of rust.</TEXT>

Along with the fact that the Kangertech dual coil designs flood like hurricanes without rewicking, in my time of owning the Aerotank and it being my only upgrade tank back then, I spent 75% of my time trying to get my Aerotank to work and 25% of the time getting as good of a vape as I did on my EVOD.</TEXT>

When talking about the best resistance range for the MVP due to the limits it has, /u/Fortinbraz said

anywhere between 1.2 (where you would hit the device's amp limit) and 2.3 (where you would hit the devices voltage limit), you are good to go up to 11W.

The problem is that when I get even close to dual coils at 1.2 ohms with 30 gauge kanthal, I'm running two coils with 2.4 ohms resistance and they heat horribly slow.</TEXT>
