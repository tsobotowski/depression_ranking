            	<TEXT>I kinda agree, in Islam there's two holy Quran which is God's word and the Hadith which is a compilation of the prophet's quotes, advices and such While I would follow the Quran word by word the Hadith can sometimes become absurd, thinks that wouldn't make sense that the Prophet would've said them ex: "kill the jews", well they didn't put like that but... All I can think of is subjectivity and propaganda were the reasons of the turning of Islam from what it was supposed to be, but yet people would call me a heretic if I question the Hadith Ps: Jesus didn't have any magical powers, it was God's will :)</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>the haddith, not all haddiths are equal some are like school gossip badly sourced, but this one actually says don't circumcise whamen x) ... amputation I'm for it if people are treated equally, something that changed after the death of Omar .... Quran 24:13 means you are not to assume someone committed adultery 'til you have 4 witnesses not a single mention of rape ... adultery is punishable by whipping not death, if all are treated equal sure, go for it as I'm against casual sex ... A male convicted of rape can have his conviction dismissed by marrying his victim, still gets whipped x) ..... Taharrush means sexual harassment ... Muhammad had more, yes, but didn't consume the marriages, check who and why he married ... Meat to eat must come from animals slaughtered in a certain way cause blood is bad for you or something we aren't vikings we do not sacrifice, Odhiya comes from Doha which means early morning and the term is used in the "Aid" ... beating of women is intriguing and I have answer for that I'll ask a friend but for the rest if it dosen't come from the Quran or a logical hadith I don't really care, the way I see it god gave me a brain to use so if i think it's unequal or dosen't make sense I don't bother with it, plus the rest you put is not sourced from the quran so can't say much ... but yeah it's fucked up, but islam wasn't meant to become what is became today, and I totally understand your point of view I would ask for you to see it from a quran perspective but language seems to be a barrier ... instead I'm gonna say this, the Prophet and the first two Khalifs (Abu Bakr and Omar) nvr killed someone for leaving the religion ... it is said clear in the quran every one is free to take their own path and believe in what they want to, which brings me back to why I think this religion deviated from it's purpose ... so I'd recommend you to read about Omar Ibn Al Khattab's life and the war for the succession after his death, which from is the turning point, Omar was a great man I think you'd like him.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>I can argue that God is just, and that makes him good in my opinion, maybe another person would think otherwise, so we need to understand what separates good from bad ... Take it like this, if there's a God he would be a being that no other is higher, perfect and lacks nothing (but limitation which is a paradox in itself), and perfect means every good trait out there, the part I kinda agree with you on is that we can't know for sure as in we can't see the full image because we're so limited, we can't know what it truly means to be perfect.</TEXT>

Negative, Murtad has to represent a danger to society, e.g leaving religion + promoting his ideas atheism/anti Islamic propaganda.</TEXT>
