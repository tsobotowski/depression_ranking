As I read the original article I saw this quote: 
 
  "Pearl Jones, 81, said Friday she received a handwritten letter from Tonia Sonju, manager of Carlyn Estates Mobile Home Park in Palmetto, ordering her to stop taking deliveries of food from the nearby Hope Church, which was bringing boxes to about a dozen homes in the park, or she would face eviction."</TEXT>

Given the vast storage capacity of even the most basic laptops, and the capacity of computers to retain metadata and even deleted material, one cannot treat an electronic storage device like a handbag simply because you can put things in it and then carry it onto a plane, Jackson said.</TEXT>

She wrote:
The imaging and search of the entire contents of Kims laptop, aided by specialized forensic software, for a period of unlimited duration and an examination of unlimited scope, for the purpose of gathering evidence in a pre-existing investigation, was supported by so little suspicion of ongoing or imminent criminal activity, and was so invasive of Kims privacy and so disconnected from not only the considerations underlying the breadth of the governments authority to search at the border, but also the border itself, that it was unreasonable.</TEXT>

Kims lawyer, David Deitch of Ifrah Law in Washington, said Jacksons ruling made clear that the government will still have all its rights to protect the border if it is doing searches that are designed to thwart crimes that are afoot at the border crossing.</TEXT>

By Gerry Ricciutti

 YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio (WKBN)  It was quiet Monday evening at the Youngstown wastewater treatment plant on Poland Avenue, but it was a very different scene around 9:15 a.m., shortly after liquid chlorine started leaking from a pipe.</TEXT>

The Himrod Avenue Expressway between U.S. Route 62 and Interstate 680 and the section of Poland Avenue in front of the plant, between Gibson Street and Powers Way, will be closed until 8 a.m. Tuesday.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1904_390_2</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Shortly after 9 a.m. Monday, workers evacuated the facility after potentially hazardous liquid chlorine began leaking from a valve as workers were trying to switch one-ton tanks of the chemical, which is used in the water treatment process.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1904_390_3</DOCNO>

Unfortunately, they lost about 500 pounds of liquid chlorine that remained in the building, that did not get mixed off, so we are going to have to slowly allow the air exchangers within that building to mix it with air and release it back into the environment, Youngstown Fire Department Battalion Chief Sil Caggiano said.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1904_390_5</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

What complicated the problem is that liquid chlorine freezes when it is exposed to the air and firefighters found a lot of what had leaked had frozen in large puddles on the floor of the building rather than evaporating into the atmosphere.</TEXT>

And until that happens, firefighters opted to close both Poland Avenue and the nearby Expressway, as well as the businesses inside the nearby Performance Place Industrial Park, as precautions.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>It was contained around 11:45 a.m.

Crews on the scene were initially worried about wind blowing the gas towards the east and northeast and sent a truck with a measuring device to the east side of the Mahoning River to check for the presence of chlorine.</TEXT>

The larks, still bravely singing, fly

"Kevin Pimentel, 12, shot his brother Brady Pimentel, 6, dead Wednesday night at their mobile home in Hudson, Florida
He shot his brother Trevor Pimentel, 16, in the leg before killing himself

Kevin and Trevor had been cooking about 6pm when an argument erupted

Their mother, Helen Campochiaro, 38, was working one of her two jobs 

Relatives say she was a single mom who kept a gun for protection and that the boys had been brought up with gun safety

On a Go Fund Me page set up one day before the shooting, Campochiaro asked for help in raising a deposit for a new home"

 The plague disease, generally thought to be caused by Yersinia pestis, is enzootic (commonly present) in populations of fleas carried by ground rodents, including marmots, in various areas including Central Asia, Kurdistan, Western Asia, Northern India and Uganda.[15] 
 
Nestorian graves dating to 1338-9 near Lake Issyk Kul in Kyrgizstan have inscriptions
referring to plague and recent investigations by the Russian archeologist Chwolson show a high incidence rate and are thought by many epidemiologists to mark the outbreak of the epidemic, from which they could easily have spread to China and India.[16] 

In October 2010, medical geneticists confirmed that the plague came from China.[4] In China, the 13th century Mongol conquest disrupted farming and trading, and led to widespread famine starting in 1331 with plague arriving soon after.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>The population dropped from approximately 120 to 60 million.[17] The 14th-century plague killed an estimated 25 million Chinese and other Asians during the 15 years before it entered Constantinople in 1347.[18]

The disease may have traveled along the Silk Road with Mongol armies and traders or it could have come via ship.[19] By the end of 1346 reports of plague had reached the seaports of Europe: "India was depopulated, Tartary, Mesopotamia, Syria, Armenia were covered with dead bodies".[20]

Plague was reportedly first introduced to Europe at the trading city of Caffa in the Crimea in 1347.</TEXT>

The Genoese traders fled, taking the plague by ship into Sicily and the south of Europe, whence it spread north.[21] Whether or not this hypothesis is accurate, it is clear that several existing conditions such as war, famine, and weather contributed to the severity of the Black Death."</TEXT>

  "One defense is reporting or passing through information as a general information or warning of dangerous or emergent conditions, and intent to defame must be proven.</TEXT>
