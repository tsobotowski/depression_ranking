I haven't heard this interesting thought yet even though I do keep my ears open (e.g. via /r/askscience), but I also disagree with it: The universe may be infinite as measurements of the last 10 or 15 years have shown, so it would have been infinite right from the start (because you can't get from finite to infinite in a non-discrete process), so the density would not have been infinite.</TEXT>

Any number above 1 will work, yes, but 1.2 etc is much too weak to fix the problem, and if you go too high, you get the opposite problem: You'll not have any change in the lower ranges, and you'll also get too quickly to a quiet volume when going down from 100%.</TEXT>

In addition to this, let me give you a good answer for why atheists don't accept the claim: Because the level of evidence that actually exists - people having feelings, visions, near-death-experiences of the divine, or just the fact that many others believe it, too - is the same that many other claims have, e.g. the claim of abductions by aliens or for Bigfoot or for the Loch Ness monster.</TEXT>

Let's translate this to Minecraft, whose emergence in regards to mob grinders I find completely fantastic, and I'm sure we'll eventually have action adventures (e.g. like Deus Ex) except with a world that is based somewhat on simulation (not just enemy-AI-simulation), so that the player can do/decide things like in Minecraft (see mob grinders).</TEXT>

Successfully establishing and balancing systems on high abstraction levels should inevitably have emergent manifestations on lower abstraction levels, like in the example of Minecraft: Mob grinder possibility, interesting landscape formations, emergent situations during battles where world effects or animals surprisingly come into play, ...

I can't give you concrete examples for your RL, but maybe you can copy the spirit that I tried to express and observe that it actually works as intended: Emergent manifestations and emergent game-reality-flow.</TEXT>

The world will *certainly* be a much better place without religion, because religion does the opposite of what science does, in two ways:

1) Instead of using the method of doubt to find greater levels of certainty, it uses the method of faith to assign levels of certainty to claims that don't deserve it.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_188_399_5</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

2) Instead of bringing the truth about the people's environment to them and thus increasing survivability and quality of life, they give fantasies the same value as actual facts and, well, basically allow people to live a life in a fantasy world: Many people sharing the same fantasy and claiming that it is actually true "makes it real" via the omnipresent people who believe *that* it is real.</TEXT>

The faster an object is moving through space, the more the arrow points in the spatial direction instead of the temporal direction, that's why while you can kind of fly arbitrarily fast from your own perspective, the universe will only let you do that by slowing your personal reality down a lot, so when you come out of it, you'll see that instead of a procrastinating object (You when stopped.),</TEXT>

Such an experience, I guess, usually instills the knowledge *anew* for some time of what it means to exist as a human, and what reality means, transporting the "will" of the flesh into the conscious mind, allowing *the person* to become more *the being* that they basically are.</TEXT>

Because you want to *achieve more with less code*, one of the many reasons being that *structuring* the code optimally for the respective project (and also respective programmer - the person's mind does play a role in this, it's not all about objective rights and wrongs) is a key part of the work, and the more unnecessary quasi-redundant baggage you have to fight with, the harder this becomes.</TEXT>

Wide angle:

Not only am I an immersion-buff (e.g. first person games with high FoV, not that I indend to do the movie in 1st person, but I haven't thought about that at all yet), I also dig Kubrick's visual style a lot, and I also think that some kind of untapped mental effect might come in if the viewer doesn't have to adapt to a new type of vision all the time.</TEXT>

Longer version (ignore or don't, but please read the short one in any case):

My definition of sanity - logically I deem those who hold a very different one to be not all that sane:

The universe / reality (of which we are a part) is the one basis for right and wrong, for reasoning, for sanity; hence sanity, for a human, would be to learn about reality and to think/decide/act in conjunction with reality - as closely as possible.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_188_1064_21</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

If you kind of agree, then what about this: To be *perfectly sane* would be to be the embodiment of the "will" of the universe. (</TEXT>

	switch (keyCode) {
	case 38: // Up
		break;
	case 40: // Down
		break;
	case 37: // Left
		break;
	case 39: // Right
		break;
	default:
		System.out.println("case " + e.getKeyCode() + ": // " + e.paramString() + "\nbreak;");
	}

So, whenever you hit a key that's not yet digested, you'll get output like this in the console:

    case 123: // KEY_PRESSED,keyCode=123,keyText=F12,keyChar=Undefined keyChar,keyLocation=KEY_LOCATION_STANDARD,rawCode=123,primaryLevelUnicode=0,scancode=88,extendedKeyCode=0x7b
    break;
    case 122: // KEY_PRESSED,keyCode=122,keyText=F11,keyChar=Undefined keyChar,keyLocation=KEY_LOCATION_STANDARD,rawCode=122,primaryLevelUnicode=0,scancode=87,extendedKeyCode=0x7a
    break;

That's the simple way, if you don't want to carry around too much code baggage / want to do it from memory.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_188_1127_4</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>If you want to get sophisticated, call this method instead:

    final public static void keyCodeSwitchHelper(final KeyEvent e) {

        final String paramString = e.paramString();
        final String startText = "keyText=";
        final int startTextPos = paramString.indexOf(startText);
        final int endPos = paramString.indexOf(",", startTextPos + 1);
        final String keyText;
        if (startTextPos  0) {
            keyText = paramString;
        } else {
            if (endPos  0) {
                keyText = paramString.substring(startTextPos + startText.length());
            } else {
                keyText = paramString.substring(startTextPos + startText.length(), endPos);
            }
        }
        System.out.println("case " + e.getKeyCode() + ": // " + keyText + "\nbreak;");
    }

Example output:

	case 112: // F1
	break;
	case 113: // F2
	break;
	case 69: // E
	break;
	case 10: // Enter
	break;
	case 18: // Alt
	break;
	case 115: // F4
	break;

You could also use this concept to get the scancode, a keyboard language layout independent key value, but this will probably only work on Windows, and if so, then you should better use this method I posted on StackOverflow which uses reflection:

I think I see now ...

The trick is to achieve for 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75 the following:

    ... - rotXDelta
    ... - rotYDelta

    ... - rotYDelta
    ... + rotXDelta

    ... + rotXDelta
    ... + rotYDelta

    ... + rotYDelta
    ... - rotXDelta 

Or rather:

    ... + rotXDelta*-1 + rotYDelta*0
    ... + rotYDelta*-1 + rotXDelta*0

    ... + rotXDelta*0 + rotYDelta*-1
    ... + rotYDelta*0 + rotXDelta*1

    ... + rotXDelta*1 + rotYDelta*0
    ... + rotYDelta*1 + rotXDelta*0

    ... + rotXDelta*0 + rotYDelta*1
    ... + rotYDelta*0 + rotXDelta*-1

Sounds like a job for Mister (co)sinus.</TEXT>

I have been pondering concepts closely related to what the headline says for *months* in a row now, so I find the currently emerging concept all this seems to converge in worthy of sharing / discussing.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>

Key aspects that emerged as attractors during my ponderings of this year:

* Should be very easy to implement, so that as little as possible stands between my story-/game-idea musings and a working game.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_188_1145_13</DOCNO>

* Should mainly build on the fantasy of the player, because I wouldn't be able to pull off (nor be willing to "waste" too much time on) adequate graphics.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_188_1145_14</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Those would also "bake" too much into place (e.g. the interface) - I am trying to stay flexible because I have been changing course *a lot*.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_188_1145_15</DOCNO>

            	<DOCNO>s_188_1145_16</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

* Should allow spatial gameplay (e.g. to move around stealthily, to hide, to stay out of view), because I kept having a strong Deus Ex 1 and "escape from pursuers" vibe and like the idea of breaking into people's homes for loot.</TEXT>

**OBJECT SYSTEM**

All my recent prototypes converged into one underlying system that I have hence put into a library: A container based object system (CBOS).</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_188_1145_18</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>At its core, it's just an object class that has a container and an inventory list, which allows arbitrarily complex object trees: a ring in a box in a drawer in a desk in a room in a sector (e.g. "apartment" in a multi-apartment house) on a floor in a house on a plot of land (e.g. police hq having main building and generator building) etc.. Building such a tree is easy: You create the desk instance, the room instance, then call "setContainer(room)" on the desk. (</TEXT>

**WHAT CAN EASILY BE DONE WITH IT**

I made console-based prototypes with this where you could select from a list of local objects (e.g. bathroom door), which lets the door add its interactions to the mainloop's list of default actions.</TEXT>

But even though I have been thinking about the spatial-gameplay-problem for quite a few hours (not just now but also months back), I can not find the solution for scenarios like these:

* Distance measuring e.g. for aiming/shooting or view checks: How could the player be at one end of a corridor, and a guard enters the corridor at the other end, too far to be dangerous, but the player needs to do something about it?</TEXT>

Maybe the closer you get to such a location, the more visible it becomes, so the first few runs would be about you having to kinda "increase the glow" until it reaches a certain level, and then some magic badaboom screen effect takes place and you are henceforth freed from this cycle of resetting things, so you can move around freely even though there was a reset, or you henceforth keep your stats, or whatever.</TEXT>

* The game could either be turn-based, like the classic ones, or it could be in real-time in 1-second-steps, and as soon as the player starts typing, the game is paused until the input line is empty again.</TEXT>

Suggestions:

* After a few attempts, I have figured out that the object model should use soft links, meaning that the objects should refer to each other via an ID number (e.g. 64 bit long), because ultimately you will face the beast that saving/loading is, and loading while related objects don't exist yet is a pain.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_188_1163_12</DOCNO>

    final public class MyApp {

        final public static void main(final String[] args) {

        }

        final private static void startUI() {
            // create, initialize, and show JFrame
        }
    }

In Java 8, you can write the call in this shorter form (this is the famous **Lambda**):

    final public static void main(final String[] args) {
        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() - {
            startUI();
        });
    }

But since the run() method body is only one command, you can even write it shorter:

    final public static void main(final String[] args) {
        SwingUtilities.invokeLater(() - startUI());
    }

An example for the instance of a class:

    final MyClass myClass = new MyClass();
    final Runnable r = myClass::myNonstaticMethod; // you can even use "this::myMethod"
    r.run();

Now, finally, an example that does not use Runnable:

    private static interface PaintMethod {
        void paint(final Graphics2D g, final MapEntry mapEntry);
    }

    final private static void paintSomething(final Graphics2D g, final MapEntry mapEntry) {
    }

With this prepared, we can now do this in a method:

    final PaintMethod pm = MyClass::paintSomething;
    pm.paint(g, me);

Suggestions:

* After a few attempts, I have figured out that the object model should use soft links, meaning that the objects should refer to each other via an ID number (e.g. 64 bit long), because ultimately you will face the beast that saving/loading is, and loading while related objects don't exist yet is a pain.</TEXT>

The sound design is remarkably bad, as everything sounds like it's squeezed through a brutal dynamic-compressor cranked up to 15, while additionally a set of high frequencies (I guess around 5 KHz) are boosted so much that it's just unpleasant and can only be beared by reducing the volume, and this is *not* to be confused with just being too loud.</TEXT>

Supposedly, this game is a descendant of System Shock and the much better System Shock 2, and while I see that they obviously took a few elements of those games, the game itself has nothing to do with those classics, it's a flat out lie to claim that it's actually a descendant, and if I purely use enjoyment as a measure, the game is at most worth 10 (rather 5, but the design, the sky-city, the pleasant companion experience, and most of all the curiosity as to how the story will continue (something the first play-through will kill) motivate a lot).</TEXT>

And to backup your savegame files, you should look for this location:

[WhereverYouInstalledSteam]\userdata\[SomeNumber]\28050\remote

If you want to search, here are a few example file names that you'd find there after you made just a few savegames:

remotecache.vdf (is in the parent folder), saveindex, gameq, gamer1, gamea1

A few words on FOV (field of view): When you set it very high, you'll observe something that people call "distortions" or "fish eye", and when you rotate your player view horizontally, you'll get the impression that there's something like a virtual sphere.</TEXT>

A few words about the FOV, because too few people seem to know the truth about it:

While the right FOV might be a game-design choice (think "Dead Space", though I personally do not agree with that stance), and while many see its relevance mainly in the ability to see more (e.g. in shooters, you see the enemies coming), ...

... the right FOV is actually about **IMMERSION**.</TEXT>

The (probably naive, at least money-wise) thought is this:

Couldn't nuclear reactors have a deep shaft underneath them with a 10 meter concrete floor and appropriate walls ...

... and it falls into the shaft, you pour more concrete onto it, fix the facility and reboot the reactor.</TEXT>

**How to prevent your Minecraft program from updating**

The "version" file in the "bin" folder in the ".minecraft" tree (that you can easily get to on Windows by running the command "%appdata%") needs to be the new one.</TEXT>

So, before you update, backup your ".minecraft" folder tree (or at least the "bin" folder within, just copy paste it where it is, a renamed copy should then be created).</TEXT>
