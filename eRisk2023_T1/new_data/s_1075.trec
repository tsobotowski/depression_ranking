If I am on one workspace, say workspace #3, and I want to move a window from it to workspace #5 (there are already things on workspace #5) then mod + Shift + 5 on the selected window creates a NEW #5 workspace instead of putting it on the existing 5th workspace, so now I have 2 "#5" workspaces.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1075_48_4</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> Anyway, in a programming structure and logic class I'm in (intro level) in our textbook, the chapter I just read described the bubble sorting algorithm for sorting data, it has flowcharts and pseudocode and I thought I'd try to translate it to python (I'm using python 3.3.4 right now) I have functions for filling an array and sorting the array and then displaying the array, the filling and displaying work now, I still gotta fix the sorting one, but the real question is, my brother was noting that it shoudn't work at all because I have global variables and I use them in my functions, well look at the code:
    
    array_size = 5
    scores_array = []
    comparisons = array_size - 1
    x = 0
    y = 0
    temp = 0
    
    def fill_array():
        x = 0
        while (x  array_size):
            userinput = input("Enter a score:\n")
            userinput = int(userinput)
            #for i in range(5):
            scores_array.append(userinput)
            x = x + 1
    
    
    def sort_array():
        y = 0
        while (y  comparisons):
            x = 0
            while (x  comparisons):
                while (scores_array[x]  scores_array[x + 1]):
                    swap()
                x = x + 1
            y = y + 1
    
    def swap():
        temp = scores_array[x + 1]
        scores_array[x + 1] = scores_array[x]
        scores_array[x] = temp
    
    def display_array():
        x = 0
        while (x  array_size):
            print(scores_array[x])
            x = x + 1
    
    fill_array()
    
    print("\n")
    
    #sort_array()
    
    display_array()

now what is interesting is my brother pointed out to me that the code above runs with no errors, yet the code below throws an error "UnboundLocalError: local variable 'var' referenced before assignment"
in this code:
    
    var = 0
    
    def addone():
        var += 1
    
    print(var)
    addone()
    print(var)
