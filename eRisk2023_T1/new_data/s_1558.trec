This is the order


Books of Blood 1,2,3

Inhuman condition

In the flesh

Cabal


When you finish Cabal you can move on to Great and Secret Show, then Everville because the character from the last books of blood story is the main character in those books.</TEXT>

The Handmaids Tale I enjoyed a lot more than I thought I would and read it mainly because I didn't want it spoiled by everyone talking about it....though the way people talk about it makes me think, they either didn't read it, or didn't understand what it was saying, because the book, despite what everyone plays it out to be, it was not a feminist agenda based book, which I thought it was going to be.</TEXT>

The philosophy is the actual book book isn't bad, if you wanna read about Napoleon invading Russia then you might get what he's talking about better, it's just the second epilogue I had a problem with, he talks about the way history is written and just kinda beats a dead horse, but the rest of the book is amazing.</TEXT>

Now the boring part, well only one really, the second epilogue, I would say, if you going in for the story part of the book, avoid the second epilogue because it has nothing to do with the story and is all philosophy on history.</TEXT>

That being said, I know it's the most talked about book that nobody reads and I cannot understand why, the book was not boring, except for second epilogue, it didn't feel like anything dragged on, and I think Tolstoy captured what being a human and all your errors is all about perfectly, I also feel that there was way too much relatable material in the book that is going on now.</TEXT>

Both good choices though, Frankenstein is my personal favorite book of all time ^^. Just check the books to make sure they're not abridged, I know Count of Monte Cristo gets cut down a lot, so if you ever go for that one, remember it's around 1300 pages not 800 lol.</TEXT>
