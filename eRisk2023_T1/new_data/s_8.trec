The rhythm is no doubt their best ever, the vocals are James' best (probably equal with *One*), the lyrics are fucking intense and cold as shit, the solo is retardedly good, and the drumming is at Lars' peak, especially with the double bass.</TEXT>

I had used it for my severe anhedonia and anxiety and it helps when I take it, but it only lasts so short (1 - 3 hours) each time I toss and swish so its not a long-term solution.</TEXT>

Some background: In the past I've tried 12 antidepressants, 8 stimulants, years of talk therapy, mediation, ketamine infusions, TMS therapy, lifestyle changes, diet and exercise, and I suspect along with my doctor that my brain has a dopamine dysfunction that does not have many real options for treatment as we don't know the exact issue with the dopamine.</TEXT>

* Prolactin	8.2 ng/mL	(4.0 - 15.2 ng/mL)

**Second blood tests (1 month ago):**

* Total Testosterone: 417 ng/dl
* Free Testosterone: 7.9 (I forget the unit type..)
* LH	7.9 mIU/mL (1.7 - 8.6 mIU/mL)
* FSH 1.9 mIU/mL (1.5 - 12.4 mIU/mL)

Fade to Black (their most emotionally gut-wrenching and saddest song, plus the most melodic Metallica solo ever imo with the opening Kirk solo)

Master of Puppets (imo it's their most epic thrash masterpiece and truly the best classic-themed thrash song ever made)

Creeping Death (such a fucking intense and rapid thrash experience, and imo the best written Metallica solo and metal solo of all time)

Nothing Else Matters (their song which reaches your heart and breaks through all bullshit that could possibly exist and makes you remember who you are.</TEXT>

These were my numbers for testosterone:

**First blood test**

* Total Testosterone: 288 ng/dl
* Free Testosterone: not measured in this one



**Second blood test**

* Total Testosterone: 417 ng/dl 
* Free Testosterone:  7.9 (I forget the unit type..)

My endocrinologist says the average range is 348-1100 for total T and says mine are okay but I know that this range factors in men up to their 90's and that the normal/ideal range for someone my age is 650-750 or higher.</TEXT>

I also am a believer now that you shouldn't keep anything you don't really plan on using again (unless you truly value it as a collectible which is an acceptable exception), so I sold my old PSP, my GameCube, my Xbox 360, my Gameboy Micro, and all their games and am in the process of selling my gaming PC because I don't value using these things as much as I value my other hobbies, and so I realized I don't plan on using them anymore.</TEXT>

I am unsure if I want an oculus, because I think its best to wait a couple years for the technology to lower in price and get better before making such a large investment, but I know that the exterminator will be oculus ready if I chose so.</TEXT>
