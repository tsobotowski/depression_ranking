At the end of the last school year the teachers on his IEP team came to us and made a recommendation that he be moved to a different building.</TEXT>

Anyway, when our pack struggled with volunteers in the past we tried the following with varying degrees of success:

Method One:

Set up the September pack meeting as a carnival, simple games that the kids love.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_2064_66_10</DOCNO>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_2064_66_11</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Method Two:

Assign the large events (camping, pinewood, blue and gold) by rank.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_2064_66_12</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> In our example we did the following:

Fall Campout (September) - Bear Den

Blue and Gold (February) - AoL Den

Pinewood Derby (March) - Wolf Den

Spring Campout - (May) - Webelos Den

Pack Picnic - (Early June) - Tigers

It takes a lot of the guesswork out, it removes the possibility of one person having to run the same event over and over and if you look at how it lays out it puts the Tigers in charge of an event that happens at the end of the year which gives them lots of time to get acclimated.</TEXT>

Here is an idea:  you plan a trip, you select the camp, you select the site, you contact the camp to make sure they can handle a large group, you send out the email inviting everyone, you coordinate that, you collect the money for the deposit, you send out the list to every family with the gear you recommend they bring, you plan the menu, you do ALL of that.</TEXT>
