in the end, you end up with either a very porous material... that is virtually 'empty' and that needs to be 'charged' before application to the soil... ....or, some 'charcoal-like', much-less-porous, gob of lower quality char that .... is still very unlikely to catch on fire... ...but, contains enough VOCs to 'repel' nutrients, microbes, fungi, and plant roots away from it until it eventually breaks down.</TEXT>

Dams also release CO2 due to the changes in the ecosystems, as well alter the way the ecosystems are capable of removing co2 due to the changes in habitat 

but, we need somewhere to bottle up that water, and getting juice from it in the process is a benefit ... so, fuck it.</TEXT>

applying the logic of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysa5OBhXz-Q) ... adapting it to hydro from wolves....   could create some pretty not-too-far-fetched theories about how more than just the immediate environment is altered due to hydro.</TEXT>

I'm not arguing for or against [hydroelectric](/r/hydroelectric) ... nor am i saying that it can't be done in more sustainable ways ... but, to say that its impacts are purely local seems a bit .... ~~naive~~ narrow in scope


edit 1: the ~~strikethrough~~ above

edit 2: to [add a link](https://strangebehaviors.wordpress.com/2014/03/10/maybe-wolves-dont-change-rivers-after-all/) that contradicts the video I'm providing as an example  ... but, only with intentions of taking a less polarized position on it and to try to look of it more objectively</TEXT>

I believe you may be over-complicating the definition of AI

for example, Merriam-Webster defines AI as: : an area of computer science that deals with giving machines the ability to seem like they have human intelligence

: the power of a machine to copy intelligent human behavior


wikipedia, obviously the standard-setter on everything and never wrong, 

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the intelligence exhibited by machines or software.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1302_986_3</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Major AI researchers and textbooks define this field as "the study and design of intelligent agents",[1] in which an intelligent agent is a system that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chances of success.[2] John McCarthy, who coined the term in 1955,[3] defines it as "the science and engineering of making intelligent machines".</TEXT>

This would give the industry the chance to get on its feet, get the infrastructure in place (as well a wider diversity of understanding how to utilize it), then allow economics of scale to kick in to both lower the price, as well increase the availability to lower quality soils that tend to have lower profit margins.</TEXT>

nothing talked about here is 'easy' to do... ....but, dump a few deca-million into something and you can be *damn* sure there'll be people paid to search what's already been written on the subject and consolidate it...   ....and, '10's of millions' *usually* has a habit of becoming hundreds of millions ... -then billions... ... so, the future is coming ... ....how long it takes to get here though we'll have to wait   see

I mean, with the right regs in place, there's really no reason drones couldn't be 'suv-sized' .... on down to these smaller pocket-sized drones....    i've always been curious about a 'drone tether' ...  like, high gauge speaker wire running between a larger drone to a smaller one powering it...   or just powering drones with cables to begin with.... I mean, a microUSB 3.0 cable is pretty small, and some are much lighter than others, and those things can pump out 100w .... ....if the cable is being supported by a hydrocarbon-fueled 'mother drone' and smaller ones are simply drawing the power from them (ie, hovering *below* them vs above them) ... then 'swarms' of drones could work together (tethered or not) to cover a few different angles of it.</TEXT>

- automation

    meaning: I want to be able to program a path... either via a map, a recorded flight that I 'train' it to do, whatever.... and then every day at preset times, it will send me a text message or app notification, I say 'go ahead' or 'delay' (in case it's raining.. and assuming it hasn't tied into local weather or something) ... ..and, basically, it'll fly along that path and record every day..  ...w/out me (really) having to do shit.</TEXT>

- automatic take off and landing... for recharging

     so if a preprogrammed flight is going to take 10 recharges to do throughout the day... it can go, do its deal, fly back to base, charge, then fly back out again and pick up where it left off (my roomba can do this)

- local 'grid' accuracy

    *like* a Roomba's 'walls' or whatever, something that lets me place sensors around the fields, the rows, etc to create markers.... be them solar powered, rfid, whatever.</TEXT>

- take a vineyard as an example

   the ability to fly both above rows... as well *between* them

- take a corn field for example

   the drones would need to have their blades covered so as to *not* get tied up... yet still be effective .... and, fly *between* rows of corn to take assessment of below-canopy crop health


- more than just imaging and sound

  this one gets tricky but... heat, moisture recording, etc

    this ties more into software that isn't drone-specific, obviously, but the ability to do radar for picking up soil erosion, moisture content, etc.</TEXT>

a lot of this ties into *other* sensor grids that could be set up on a farm... and, lots of other technologies beyond *just* drones *but*... the drone could play a *critical* part in enhancing this


- to act as a temporary wifi repeater ....

    so, if i have a grid set out on a farm but it's too far away from the barn or what not to download data... .. to be able to fly out and connect to it, but not just download data (or upload it) ... but also to tie that part of the grid to the drone... then the drone, in turn, to bridge to the barn or what not...

...though, this is largely silly, but it'd still be nice software to have in the drone ... given that the drone *may* be network-connected-capable so why *not* include something similar.</TEXT>

my brother was too early for it when he got his... he had to go back for one readjustment in like 2003, and then the next one he went in he got the wave front shit (wave mapping, wave front ... it goes by different 'brand names' but it's essentially all the same tech).</TEXT>

as far as answering an incoming call.... the same: I either answer it and avoid the areas of my house with shitty coverage or.... I don't answer it, connect to wifi, then call them back... 

and, this is on both phones and I've used two different routers to do this with... so I'm guessing it's *not* the routers, as I don't (seem to) have any problems with my other devices ...  ...  and, well, the air rave deal... it works great ... ...when it works, but I actually get *better* coverage with my wifi once its up vs if i go in my basement or something the signal from the AirRave can drop to a bar or two... vs my wifi is pretty much always full-bars everywhere in my house.</TEXT>

I suppose my point is: yeah, wifi calling is awesome (it really is, the call quality is far superior to even the HD-quality the AirRave gets when it can) ... when it works.</TEXT>

...but, *that* it's still in its first-gen phones (or, now 2nd gen with the M9/G4/S6 lines coming out) ... and many carriers don't even offer it yet ... ...I suppose it's a bit premature to be *too* hard on it.</TEXT>

oh, and, the obvious limitation of *both* setups (AirRave *and* wifi-calling) that you can't originate a call on wifi/airrave then leave ... ...w/out dropping the call.</TEXT>

also, coming into range of the wifi/AirRave doesn't mean you autoconnect to those networks...

so, definitely there, but definitely still needing some 'tweaking' to get working right.</TEXT>

this is where the PSBs come in... with their 'hammer   cleave' enzymatic 'action', they're able to break the P free, use it for 'whatever' reason they use it for... and when they die, the P that they freed up is now in a bioavailable form for the plants to utilize ... before the process repeats itself (either binding to other elements... ...or becoming usurped by yet more PSBs... ...or being utilized by the plant).</TEXT>

With that, there's 'supposedly' *decades* of phosphorus in the soils... ... it's just a matter of making it (bio)available for the plants ... thus, biological fertilizers (fungal, microbial, 'etc') ....

 I obviously wouldn't recommend dropping these on civilian areas

and yet there are many claims of this having happened.... and in very recent history

 The precision nature of the weapons makes it the best choice even for that situation

yet still not as 'precise' as a yet-smarter bomb... ...that doesn't blanket an area with countless unneeded bomblets

higher Ts do a few things that improve the quality of the char

1) increase the porosity *and* activation of the char

2) 'cook-out' the bio-oils, 'waxes', and other VOCs that serve to *repel* 'things' from the char .. ...until they're finally broken down

3) the 'weaker' C-C bonds are simply broken and gasified ... leaving the char with the rest of the gas stream... and the ones that remain behind *tend* to have stronger C-C bonds, hold together longer, and overall, provide for a more stable, longer-lasting, and all-'round 'better' char.</TEXT>

though... there is a 

D) to this... and that is: there'll be less resulting biochar from the source feedstock... and the char that *does* remain, *being* both more porous *and* more activated... will pull in all the more nutrients from the soil, and faster... and possibly hold onto 'tighter'... causing the soil to take a harder initial 'hit'  before it all works itself out.</TEXT>

but, the advantage to this is *) *if* the char is 'weathered' first ... or, better, pre-blended with nutrients, minerals, compost, other amendments, microbes, etc ... and *then* worked into the soil.. ....it will not *only* be 'loaded up', but it will begin to near-immediately work itself into the rest of the soil in such a way that there's almost an immediate improvement to the soil... ...and, with only more to come as the biota in the soil (plants included... but fungi, microbes, etc) help to make those pre-blended nutrients all the more bioavailable *to* the soil.</TEXT>

Not enough interest in autism: people think the lack of attention   ignorance towards it is ridiculous and run 'campaigns' to 'raise awareness' 

Too many papers published with too many different theories: people complain that there's too much going on with it

~~about to run out of characters~~ ran out of characters but... the point of all of that was, this starts to cut into the fossil fuel demand, while at the same time fitting very nicely *in*to its infrastructure (syngas *is* short for synthesis gas after all... and, as such, can be up-converted *to* methane and ethane and.. well, like cool planet's doing, 'grassoline') if not straight replace it...     biomass gasification in such that biochar is a resulting product is not just the only form of energy out there that's carbon *negative*, it's also pretty much the only *thing* that's out there that's carbon negative... that's not just been used every day for centuries, but that's been made naturally since lighting caught the first field on fire before the subsequent thunderstorm put out the fire before it all burned to ash.</TEXT>

*If* the model is advanced forward from where it was in the solve for x vid though... ...and the switchgrass is grown *not* for liquid transport fuels (or less for it anyway)...

...and it's instead grown for its 'raw energy content' (read: hydrogen / syngas production), and their 'ovens' are more set to just 'cook' the switchgrass and produce a lot of char and a lot of syngas...

...and the process is tied into something like GE's CO2 fertilization designs

whereby the 'waste heat' produced is used to first dry the incoming materials (need to get the biomass at a 15% moisture content level ... think 'dry or aged firewood') and then use the other 'waste heat' produced in a co-generation or tri-generation set up (to heat or to cool a greenhouse or other facility) ... the syngas to power a turbine first producing power for the production facilities, then the greenhouse lighting, fan, etc facilities, and then selling the rest on the grid as electricity... ....or selling/blending the syngas either as a n.gas substitute, or blending it with n.gas kinda like ethanol w/ gasoline ...   

...the problem with doing this with syngas is it's pretty much CO+H2   ... and H2 just doesn't store well.</TEXT>

 the only realistic way that we can do anything about the CO2 problem

making all the biochar we can make will only help slow the tide relative to what we're emitting..... the badass thing about biochar is though that it's both a carbon negative approach (and pretty much the *only* carbon negative approach out there .. ..that's realistically implementable)  *and* an energy 'source'.</TEXT>

There are NDAs involved with both so there's a little bit of discretion needed in how I word this but...  well... 'most products' tend to be a *lot* cheaper when you buy in bulk directly from the source vs going through 'countless'-party (3rd party) retailers.</TEXT>

Actually, and this makes perfect sense if I felt like typing it all out (which I don't and you probably already know) .. but, the plants actually tend to grow *smaller* in nutrient/mineral-rich soils... as well the individual crop *from* the plant (fruit, veggie, etc).... ....*but*, the turn around seems a lot faster and the overall *yield* is usually a lot larger...

obviously there's a varying reason for this (crop-type, soil conditions, etc) ... but, take tomatoes for example: the size of each tomato *isn't* usually this gigantic 'softball' but more like tennis balls, maybe even a bit *smaller* in fact... but, they're heavier and the plants tend to grow a *lot of 'em*!</TEXT>

I'm assuming that as the stuff gets rained down into deeper   deeper layers of the soil, the plants will need to grow deeper   wider roots to extract the less-dense nutrients/minerals and, as such, that should 'alter' things a bit.</TEXT>

I mean, sure I'd prefer a back speaker as well.... esp if i put my phone on my nightstand screen/speaker-down and am using it for an alarm clock, but the speakers on the M8 are so much better than the G3 that even when I use *it* as the alarm clock *over* my G3 it actually seems to do a better job waking me up.</TEXT>

but, again, if it comes down to 'plug in over there and wait three hours' or 'run through that car wash which your car needs anyway and I can swap it out in 15' I'd imagine the guy that's driving a $65k+ car is going to say, 'i've got $5' :)

the battery-swap model really makes a lot of sense.</TEXT>

I mean, last night after I typed that last message I went to the grocery store and a like 95lb 5'4 employee-girl was moving around a pallet of canned goods on a [pallet jack](http://www.handtrucksrus.com/pallet_lifts/272149%20[zoom].jpg) with seemg-ease... so a specialty designed deal and a 'trained   licensed' (and usually 'male'0 employee would doubtfully have a huge problem with it?</TEXT>

but, also/again, this was like 2 years ago... i mean, just-over a year (fall 2013) when I talked to the guy, and he'd owned the car for at least a few months before that, plus the design itself probably at least 6 months before that so... a 2 year old design, and, well, in thelast two years /r/teslamotors will clearly show you that something like that *hasn't* come out (yet) so... ...it may've just been something they were *testing*...  but it made one helluva lot of sense to me.</TEXT>

so, the 4 batteries were in serial acting as a single battery (ie, whatever singular voltage the batteries were rated for, they *weren't actually double-A's or they'd be 1.5v.. but they were playing around with the idea of them *being* AA's to reduce cost via volume) .... then the 4-AA packs acted in parallel with the other 4-AA packs in the 'rail' ... to increase the voltage.. ...as well, each parallel design allows independent charging... so, though each individual AA isn't getting charged independently by the whole system, each 4-pack of them is.</TEXT>

I also like the idea (again, being an Audi/quattro fan) of independently powered tires.... Teslas X has dual engines, with a more traditional mechanical system to control power output per tire... per axle....  ...I forget why Musk said he went with a dual-engine (front/back) with the Model X vs 4 independent engines per tire... has something to do with weight/efficiency ... but, the idea that you can power an individual tire with an independent engine and, thus, control on a microsecond level the power output per tire... traction, turning, etc... ...

as *well* the fact that the power from the electric motor *to* the tire is almost immediate... no (significant) build up in power needed... vs a gas engine... ...instant full-power torque *and* the handling to match.</TEXT>

the weight can be centered differently as well such as to balance the car side to side / front to back axises, as well it can have a really low-to-the-ground weight deal... so the car (truck, suv, sav, hybrid design, whatever) *isn't* top-heavy....  fast!</TEXT>

the moment the tires hit the ground the entire right side of the car (ie, the outside tires) hit the ground, grabbed the road as they got traction and totally jerked the wheel really hard left.. went off the road *to* the left, off a sort of 'cliff' that was about 8ft tall through a few trees, down the hill, and slammed into this big fucking tree that knocked the car to the right... thus, flipping it over.</TEXT>

my only wonder is: what if they put radar into drones in such that the drone could detect an oncoming 'something' and be auto-programmed to 'take action' (which would basically mean turn off the engines and drop as quickly as possible ... turning engines back on once the 'minimal safe distance' is achieved and/or the ground is right there)

again,with everything else you've written... totally agree.</TEXT>

Kinda moot talking about or comparing given the G4 isn't even announced yet, let alone available ... 

but, my point is... even if waiting for the G4, the only real difference seems to be the jump up in proc-type (like the M9) and a slightly increased screen resolution (but the G3 *still* has higher res than the M9.... ....and, even my M8's resolution is more than high enough imo.</TEXT>

Higher-T's char needs loading all the more though... ...it isn't just because the higher porosity 'pulls in' and 'on' nutrients in the soil (kinda-sorta 'robbing' the soil from the *immediate*-availability of these nutrients) ... or that it pulls in *more* of these because of the higher porosity... but, the higher activation also means that it can pull them in faster, deeper, and hold onto them a bit stronger.</TEXT>

If pigs can be presented in such a way that both their intelligence *and* their personalities can be put in front of the public eye on a regular basis... the idea of eating these brilliant creatures (that are also the single largest tapeworm carrier in the average person's diet) would hopefully become as detestable as eating dogs or cats.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>it doesn't have to come with 4gb... but to have it configured in such a way that it could be increased...

2) if the USB port were 3.0 in such that I could use a usb key to increase the ram-ability of it.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>I've never done that whole use a usb-key as ram before but I've heard/read good things and... would possibly suffice *not* having 4gb of ram

            	<DOCNO>s_1302_1988_15</DOCNO>

but, if the keyboard has the ability to slide in an extra battery... as well, that extra battery to charge the device... as well, be able to *be* charged independent of the device ... in such that I could keep it charging ... carry the screen around... and then plug the screen-keyboard together to charge the screen... as well to give juice to the screen... both, at the same time. ...</TEXT>
