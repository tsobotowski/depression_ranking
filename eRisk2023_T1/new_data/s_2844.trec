What this means is that in almost every state (I can guess at 1 or 2 exceptions, but I won't, because I'm not sure), if you have a driver's license or state-issued ID card **it doesn't matter at all what party you are registered with, or if you are even registered to vote, period**...you will still end up on the jury duty roster.</TEXT>

I started sharing the names of authors, books, and other publications I "grew up on," but I was a teen in the late '80s through mid-'90s, so the names that spring to my mind are Audre Lorde, Joanna Russ, and Adrienne Rich...and magazines like "On Our Backs."</TEXT>

Once your lien holder sent the title to the MVA, what you were "supposed" to do was immediately title the vehicle in MD and spend an extra $20 (in addition to the title fees and taxes) to put a temporary (30-day) tag on the vehicle that would have allowed you time to make the repairs it needed to pass inspection.</TEXT>

There is literally nothing I can add that /u/tornlace hasn't already explained perfectly clearly about why "turning a lesbian straight" isn't a thing, but I have the sense that you aren't interested in who lesbians really are; you're only interested in the idea of women being sexual with other women insofar as it is related to your own sexual gratification -- especially when it appeals to your ego and vanity, too.</TEXT>

Many elements of Zionist ideology/policy have always struck me as lacking internal coherence...What I'm saying is that *despite* the fact that I still feel this way, the level of antisemitism that is visible and accepted in the U.S. has risen so markedly over the past few months that I am seriously examining whether I am safe in the community where I live and wondering whether Israel, will all of its warts, wouldn't be a better option.</TEXT>
