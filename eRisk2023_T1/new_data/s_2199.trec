As for the advantages offered by budding over binary fission, we can just speculate two points: 1) Offer a mechanism to localize the division septum in the absence of ftsZ 2) Offer the possibility of switching growth phases by regulating protein sharing between mother and daughter cells, for example switching from a differentiating EB to a fully growing RB, switching from an RB to an EB, switching from an RB to a PB.</TEXT>

 My understanding is that recent work (from Liechti and others) suggests a model where Chlamydia still needs (and has) enough peptidoglycan (PG) to form a septum.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_2199_610_3</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>The PBP enzymes that insert/act on this PG ring are coordinated by "bacterial actin" MreB (which normally organizes elongation, not division) rather than "bacterial tubulin" FtsZ. However, FtsQ (normally part of the FtsZ-coordinated division machinery) still localizes to the septum.</TEXT>

     Do you think that Chlamydia's asymmetric division is adaptive, or do you think it's a byproduct of a bug that lives in a fairly unique environment (intracellular) that has a stripped down "minimal machinery" for division, and that this set of minimal machinery happens to be disregulated enough that it now doesn't have much control over septum placement?</TEXT>

We recently published an article titled [Membrane Vesicles of Group B Streptococcus Disrupt Feto-Maternal Barrier Leading to Preterm Birth](http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens/article?id=10.1371/journal.ppat.1005816) in [PLOS Pathogens](http://journals.plos.org/plospathogens).</TEXT>

It is a well established fact that colonization of vagina and cervix of pregnant women with Group B Streptococcus (GBS), an opportunistic pathogen, significantly increases the probability of preterm birth.</TEXT>

Finally, it is unclear exactly what the relative roles of the two known transmission modes are at this point, but the fact that both exist suggest the the virus might have some evolutionary potential that we haven't seen yet (i.e., instead of occasional sexual transmission being a byproduct of immune evasion, it could become an actual transmission route that's part of Zika's evolutionary strategy).</TEXT>

The [PLOS Genetics article](http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005876) focused on determining the DNA sequence of the fungus and applies it by focusing on two major aspects of current banana production: overall susceptibility of the crop and reduced efficacy of disease control agents (fungicides).</TEXT>

Ms. Callahan believes there are several salient points in these three articles:

     *   Given the prominence of the MDGs in the development of global health agendas, it is important to consider greater implementation of NTD strategies in achieving the MDGs (and from the post-2015 Sustainable Development Goals); and
     *   Emerging evidence shows people infected with NTDs are more susceptible to becoming infected with the big three (HIV, malaria, tuberculosis).</TEXT>

One conclusion we share in the latter paper is that ice sheet models that guided [IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change)](http://www.ipcc.ch/) sea level projections and upcoming United Nations meetings in Paris are far too sluggish compared with the magnitude and speed of sea level changes in the paleoclimate record.</TEXT>
