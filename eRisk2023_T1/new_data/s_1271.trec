But here in the Advent-darkened room

Where the dry black bread and the sugarless tea

Of penance will charm back the luxury

Of a child's soul, we'll return to Doom

The knowledge we stole but could not use.</TEXT>

And the newness that was in every stale thing

When we looked at it as children: the spirit-shocking

Wonder in a black slanting Ulster hill

Or the prophetic astonishment in the tedious talking

Of an old fool will awake for us and bring

You and me to the yard gate to watch the whins

And the bog-holes, cart-tracks, old stables where Time begins.</TEXT>

O after Christmas we'll have no need to go searching

For the difference that sets an old phrase burning-

We'll hear it in the whispered argument of a churning

Or in the streets where the village boys are lurching.</TEXT>

Who barrow dung in gardens under trees,

Nor analyse God's breath in common statement.</TEXT>

Of pleasure, knowledge and the conscious hour-

And Christ comes with a January flower.</TEXT>

There is a place in the heart that will never be filled


a space


and even during 

the best moments

and

the greatest times

we will know it


we will know it more than ever

There is a place in the heart that will never be filled

and

we will wait

and wait
