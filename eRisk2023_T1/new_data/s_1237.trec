Little One don't be afraid of this big river,

Be safe in those warm arms forever,

Grow tall my child, be wise and strong,

But do not take from any man his song,

Little one, don't be afraid of this dark night,

Walk boldly as you see the truth and light,

Love well my child, laugh all day long,

But do not take from any man his song."</TEXT>

So equation for y direction is:

v = y/t + 1/2 * g * t

Thus,  =  from your 2nd equation

However first equation is not correct for equilibrium of point B:

T_AB cos+ T_CB cos = F2 = 1000

Thus, cos = 1000/1800 = 5/9

tan = sqrt(1/ cos^2  -1) = 2/5 * sqrt(14) = 2/x

x = 5/sqrt(14)

1) It is good enough to prove prove LHS-RHS0, so lets say we have a function y= x^2 - 2x + 2

2) The minima of this function is at x  =1

3) y(1) =1, hence y = 1 for all x, in our case y = 0 will suffice

4) coshx  x^2 /2 + 1 from expansion series hence coshX  x</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> oh sorry lets try with quadratic, i mean let the path be  y = ax^2 + bx  + c
you know three cordinates (x1,y1), (x2,y2), (x3,y3), if you substitute you get three equations and three unknows a,b,c. After solving for a,b,c you have an equation, just vary the x from minimum to maximum with to get y every time.</TEXT>
