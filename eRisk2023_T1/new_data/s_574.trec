 I think at the end of the season, the votes are going to come down more to "what they think they did with what" - do they prefer Harden leading a challenge for the SW division title and 2nd seed with an extreme dearth of normal starter minutes logged; Westbrook with triple doubles left and right, a nasty bark and nastier bite and a taste for upset on his tongue; or Curry, putting up one of the most beautifully efficient exhibitions of guard play in ages, on one of the most dominant and successful teams the regular season has witnessed?</TEXT>
