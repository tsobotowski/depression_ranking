Moreover, it's worth noting that the NYPD's ban of chokeholds goes back to 1985, when an order from then-police commissioner Raymond Kelly stated, "choke holds, which are potentially lethal and unnecessary, will not be routinely used", and only permitted their use when an officer's life was in danger and the chokehold was the "least dangerous alternative method of restraint".</TEXT>

Perhaps unscheduled telework/leave, followed by early dismissal would have cut out enough people from coming in to the office to avert a Commutageddon 2.0, but since Commutageddon in 2011, OPM has made a conscientious effort to put the safety of employees first, even if at times, they end up overreacting to a bust forecast.

**the tl;dr version is (1) that Bush made obscenity prosecution a major feature of his Justice Department; and (2) that the most recent Republican Platform and Mitt Romney made it clear they intended to use current obscenity law on the books to go after 100s of types of images and movies, and if Senators or others raised hell, we seem to have both missed it.**</TEXT>
