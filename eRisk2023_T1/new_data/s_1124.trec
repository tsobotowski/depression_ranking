The kind of things I like looking at are:

Wildlife and Nature

Old buildings and architecure

Old artefacts and objects

Space

Landscapes

Fantasy stuff (LotR type things - pictures or art)


If anyone knows any good ones, that aren't in the categories above, I'll definitely consider them.</TEXT>

He compared it to City's approach, where they were still passing the ball around in the last few minutes of the game against QPR that they needed to win the league the previous year, and of course, Aguero popped up and stuck it away.</TEXT>

I actually agree that the Swedish league is stronger than the Scottish league at the moment, but the fact of the matter is that, in European terms, we're both pretty mediocre, and don't exactly set Europe alight these days, so I doubt many people outside our own countries will know any of our teams players.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> Yeah, it's odd that when someone like Redknapp says almost the exact same thing, it gets very few upvotes, but when Rodgers says it, it suddenly becomes a stunning piece of insight.</TEXT>

Although from comments I read in other places where the Redknapp story was printed, it seemed like people were suggesting that Redknapp himself is guilty of offering huge wages to players, although not necessarily youngsters.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> Hi everyone,

I'm currently playing through the Terran campaign on Hard, and one of the things I'm trying to implement in my games is the formation of choke points leading to my base so that it funnels the enemy into a smaller point, the zerglings especially.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1124_590_5</DOCNO>

My main question is, will the enemy always run into the smallest point of the funnel, or will they just start attacking the furthest away supply depots, which would kind of defeat the whole purpose of the choke point.</TEXT>

In my reply I said they may still try and fix the match regardless, as these things often involve lots of money and they might feel it was worth the risk.</TEXT>

So, in summary, any players from any sport who get involved in match-fixing are likely to know that they're being watched or that the consequences of being caught would be dire, but the money to be made can be enough of a temptation to try it.</TEXT>

 With a favourable draw, an impressive squad supporting him, and without Diego Maradona being behaviourally barmy and tactically unhinged in the dugout, the stage is set for one of the greatest footballers of all time to retake the lead in his personal World Cup goalscoring head-to-head against Brighton's Matthew Upson, which currently stands tantalisingly poised at 1-1.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> Hi everyone, Tomb Raider is on sale in Steam at the moment and I'm definitely going to snap it up, but was wondering what the different versions include (well just surviuval and GOTY because vanilla is obvious!).</TEXT>

The reason I ask is because I bought Dead Space 2 GOTY and wish I hadn't because I hate the way that some of the DLC gives you better equipment earlier than you would normally get it, and I want to avoid that if I can with TR.</TEXT>

Does survival just add extra multiplayer maps, or does it include some equipment as well?</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>A lot of comments focus on the fact that foods shouldn't be taught as good or bad, and that things like crisps etc.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1124_1188_4</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>But while it's clear that everyone on this thread is well educated in what a child's diet should look like, the reality is that a lot of parents are either uneducated, or simply don't care, judging from some of the packed lunches I've seen pupils bring in, packed with crisps, fizzy drinks, sweets etc.</TEXT>

People might also say that it's none of the school's business what a parent wants to feed their child, but I personally disagree with this.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Of all the schools I've worked in, only one has not had a healthy eating policy, which meant pupils could bring in whatever they want, and the behaviour in that school was definitely the worst I've ever encountered.</TEXT>

Like I said, I agree that the situation contained in the link is overkill of the highest order, but to the people who are outraged that the school is trying to dictate what the pupils eat - it's done for the right reasons, but implementation of it is often troublesome.</TEXT>
