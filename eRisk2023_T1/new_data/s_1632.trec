If we assume that poverty is the deciding factor in homicides, and consider that while 1/4 of the black population lives in poverty, only 1/13 of the white population does (using /u/AsthmaticMechanic 's numbers here), why doesn't it make sense that there would be a lot more black on black murders than white on white?</TEXT>
