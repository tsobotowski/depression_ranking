            	<TEXT>I had to crack open another mouse to pull a seperate copper plate out to replace it with because it was such poor quality and couldnt get the switch plate to effectively complete the circuit without it falling off the housing, not making proper contact due to inability to return to its original shape or just failing to even bend to complete the circuit due to flimsyness.</TEXT>
