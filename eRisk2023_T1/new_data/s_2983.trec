*The lawsuit, filed on the basis of gender and disability discrimination, comes as the embattled network faces mounting claims of sexual harassment and racial discrimination*

Fox News reporter Diana Falzone filed a lawsuit Monday against the network claiming she was sidelined from appearing on-air after writing an article detailing a medical condition which led to her infertility.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_2983_117_1</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Falzone, host of Fox411 and other FoxNews.com shows, alleges that three days after her company-approved article titled "Women Should Never Suffer in Silence" ran in January, she was informed by her manager that she would never again be permitted to host her own show, conduct her own interviews, or even do voiceovers.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_2983_117_2</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

In the article, Falzone shared that she suffered from endometriosis  a condition where the tissue that normally lines the inside of the uterus actually grows outside of the uterus.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_2983_117_4</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Shortly after the article was published, Falzone's supervisor told her the "second floor"  which houses the offices of Fox News executives  permanently banned her from appearing on air.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_2983_117_5</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

"The male-dominated senior management of Fox News obviously objected to the
fact that a female on-air host had disclosed that she suffers from a women's reproductive health condition, which, in their eyes, detracted from her sex appeal and made her less desirable," the lawsuit states.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_2983_117_6</DOCNO>

Falzone also says she asked for an explanation, but her supervisor allegedly told her to look for another job.</TEXT>

She *does* mix facts with opinion, but the research backs up the expert opinion, and she's so good at presentation I can understand how it miffs conservatives, but you can't say she ain't qualified to give an expert opinion, and you cannot dispute the facts or how informative her videos are to both sides.</TEXT>

I also think, there's that argument, that when you suddenly legalize something(and it's not that sudden anymore) that because the education is behind and the experience is less, that you will at first have more incidents of stupidness, or the appearence of more stupidness, due to the legal accessible pot at first...of course as the people catch up the education/experience that after not long the incidents are less than when illegal.</TEXT>
