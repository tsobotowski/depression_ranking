Don't take me bad, but honestly I don't even feel like answering that considering that we both will end up disagreeing and you seem to have a pretty "passive aggressive" manner of talking (might just be your "normal way", but to me it reads as such), so... I think you'd probably have better results asking that on another sub not related to BP/RP.</TEXT>

Either way, it's odd how different it is; while here a good 3/4 will boo you and call you a ton of names if you show a different view about gender roles (including, that woman who was punched in the face recently was being accused here and comments of the "she must have done something to deserve that, she's at guilt for that", "save that video/gif, it's not everyday we see equality about men and women" were thrown around like the most common thing in the world... and when a guy called the man who punched her a coward, everyone went to "call him out" on that and said it was "equality" to let her go through that) and such, where these guys live is the other way around.</TEXT>

He said the bad side of "princess culture" was "women thinking they were entitled to everything men had" (making them pay for everything along with other stuff I later asked that proved his transition *and thus ended up in an argument*, but I'll keep the details because it still leaves me pretty amazed in a not-so-good-way that someone would think this way), so... what the fuck would be the "good side" according to this mindset?</TEXT>
