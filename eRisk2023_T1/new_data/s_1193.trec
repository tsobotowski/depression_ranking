Returning to the very original parent comment - 

He's a Rookie and he matched Aaron Rodgers (okay maybe not matched, but certainly competed with)

I think (my opinion, you can disagree) that OP's original intention was very true - as a rookie, he went toe to toe with possibly the greatest QB to ever play.</TEXT>

I don't think it's terribly incorrect, and (again, IMO), I don't think it's terribly disrespectful towards Rodgers to say that Dak was able to hold his own against him.</TEXT>

If my initial setup has the Extruder carriage pressed up against the X sensor and I do Home All, it sounds like it tries to go left for 1/2 a second (slight grinding noise against the belt), then stops and chills.</TEXT>

But if I, say, have the Z 1/2 way up and in the middle of the X/Y, and I run Home All, the Extruder carriage/X motor sends it all the way to the right (away from the sensor) then starts making grinding noises for a few seconds, then the Y and Z finish aligning perfectly.</TEXT>

Edit: Oh a few other important points, possibly/probably also Oregon-specific : 

1) You had to have a police report.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1193_1118_16</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> 

2) You had to file your claim within a certain amount of time, I believe 3 months was the window?</TEXT>
        </DOC>

            	<DOCNO>s_1193_1118_17</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>So you couldn't fill out the forms, "yeah my bike was stolen last year..."

3) As hinted at but I didn't clearly state - you needed a receipt/some other form of proof of cost of reimbursement.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1193_1118_18</DOCNO>

1a) Ocean -  
Pros -  
* Variation in building (can build underwater, at surface, in the sky)  
*  More space (it's unlikely we'd have people building *right* at our border as usual), which also means we don't need to worry as much about initially claiming an area, and also room to expand later  
Cons  
* At least at the start, more difficult to build things (dirt towers from ocean floor to surface, or surface to sky, or building underwater)  
*  Early-rev travel difficulties (if no ocean portal) - boats are glitchy, swimming long distances, (early-mid) no horses until bridge(s) are made

Other ideas that we didn't spend much time on, but maybe you have ideas and thoughts on them...

A) Helping to build server-wide infrastructure earlier on (such as CARBON)

B) a Rose mega-build - like a continuation of the townhomes in this rev, but where basically the whole city is a "single" build...somehow...

For most of those people with that problem there are two solutions -

~~1) You can revert to the previous version of Rose Pack.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1193_1166_3</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> At the Technic launcher startup screen, click "mod options" in the upper right, and select use a specific version (0.6).~~ - sorry, I thought this was up, it isn't.</TEXT>
        </DOC>

            	<DOCNO>s_1193_1166_4</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

2) You can use the latest version with the following fix that mostly works - on pc, go to your /.technic/modpacks/rosepack/mods/ folder - make a new folder there /backup.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1193_1166_5</DOCNO>

        </DOC>

            	<DOCNO>s_1193_1166_8</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

That **should** work, but if text still doesn't work - in the following suggested order, move the following mods 1 by 1 into the /backup folder and relaunch until things work right :P  -

There's no way this was an accident in the way it was directed; those kids were *meant* to be included in the first shot and not included in the second.</TEXT>

One possible explanation I can come up with is these kids represented Elliot's childhood/innocence - topics that were brought up in his conversation with Mr Robot.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1193_1178_14</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> The song they're listening to is by Mos Def, and I'm pretty sure (not 100%) that this track is from the early 90s, or when Elliot would have been about the age of all the kids in that scene.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1193_1178_15</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> 

So Mr Robot pushing him off the rails/the kids disappearing, it was Elliot basically trying to wake himself up, tell himself "you aren't a kid anymore," and that he won't be "normal" like all those other kids.</TEXT>

[The painting in question](http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/2012/06/08/arts/08FRAME_SPAN/08FRAME_SPAN-articleLarge-v3.jpg) features this exact confrontation - an angry Roman guard confronting Peter, while a maiden steps between them to intervene.</TEXT>

Some quotes from a NYT article on the painting that seem to bear relevance on the episode - 

"In the best-known works darkness and light wage a battle" - I think we've seen a good bit of this throughout the series, but in the cinematography of the last few episodes, it seems especially relevant.</TEXT>

"On the wall, the painting is even muddier than in reproductions  most of the light comes weakly over the guards right shoulder, falling on Peter, who makes a universal gesture of blamelessness, turning both hands toward his chest, as if protesting at that moment: Me?</TEXT>

2) I can easily see how this idea could overwhelm server resources, so it could A) only ~~mayors~~ clanchat owners could use this feature to send mails, and/or B) the mail doesn't *have* to be sent instantaneously, but say one user gets mailed per minute...so a large town (150 users), it takes 150 minutes to send each user the mail.</TEXT>

Some thoughts just off the top of my head - 

1a) change the "planned restart" message to a different color than all of the other messages from the alert list.</TEXT>
        </DOC>

            	<DOCNO>s_1193_1298_14</DOCNO>

            	<DOCNO>s_1193_1298_16</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

1b) Specifically mention in the "planned restart" message to close your inventory and STOP TRADING.</TEXT>

Some disclaimers/notes :

1) I'm assuming there was a fair bit of artistic license in terms of killings, and the Crows will probably end up with more than 64 people still alive when all is said and done.</TEXT>

3) Again, it was dark and a lot of them were wearing similar outfits, so a kill credited to the Wildlings might easily have been a Crow kill instead, and vice versa.</TEXT>

1b) But, being a (possibly) portal town also generally means more popularity, thus more noobs/griefers/storage-emptiers...so yeah being a portal town would probably mean more work from the higher-ups keeping on top of all of that.</TEXT>

I'm not suggesting this purely as a punitive sort of measure, but thinking it might also encourage "some" people to help contribute; i.e. the "general" meat chest is empty so they decide to go breed/kill a lot to resupply, which may help them earn a "trusted" supply room status.</TEXT>

I can't remember which match it was during Champion's League, but I did a really great job of not looking at any popups of the score from the other match...until the 90th minute when I accidentally saw the score and thought, "Well I guess I won't watch that other match I recorded after all..."

What happens is - I have a video playing on VLC, I launch DayZ, and the video keeps playing in a way, the audio is still going and if I alt tab the frame catches up to the playback.</TEXT>

3) Similar idea but different - go to r/all/new/ and do the same thing.</TEXT>

3) There's the phalanx-style of attacking, where the front line has their tall (4 feet or so) shields, and the line behind them have spears and they're stabbing over the tops of the shields...so it seems like those shields would be very strong against the spears/swords they'd go against.</TEXT>

[I wrote about this problem on /r/nfl awhile back](http://www.reddit.com/r/nfl/comments/xabry/dear_rnflers_this_started_as_a_joke_on/) but looking at some of my submissions in other places - in /r/movies I have a 218 self.post with 738 comments, in /r/startrek another self.post that's 173/363, another /r/nfl post is 99/340, a /r/gameofthrones post is 92/630...those are all self.posts.</TEXT>

There are obvious exceptions - just because something is a link post it doesn't mean good discussions won't happen; and just because something is a self post doesn't mean the number of comments will always be greater than the number of upvotes.</TEXT>

Edit: This is the best I could find and it's nothing definitive - 

Additional crews[edit]
The NFL currently employs 17 officiating "crews"one for each of the 16 games played, plus one extra.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1193_1387_7</DOCNO>

        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1193_1387_8</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>The league claimed this would improve the quality of officiating, since they would have a larger pool of qualified officials to choose from, rewarding the best performing crews, and giving them more flexibility to "sideline" or "bench" poor performing ones.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1193_1387_9</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>The union indicated that they believed the NFL was using the issue to distract from the core issues in the negotiations, due to the fact that the proposition was introduced so late in the negotiating process,[22] and because a provision for adding officials already existed in the previous CBA.[23] However, referees felt that making it easier to "bench" them undermined their job security, and since officials are paid based on the number of games worked, increasing the number of officials would invariably reduce the number of games worked per official, thereby reducing each official's average pay for a full season

It doesn't say what the official (pun wasn't intended) decision was in the end.</TEXT>

**Okay I'm seriously getting into spoilers here for real, I know I only hinted before but it gets serious now so back out if you don't want more**

I mean...Arya moves to a different continent and basically "starts over" for a good portion of what would be the next two seasons...Jon goes through similar (though not as geographic) changes...Dany is basically caught in politics on a far off continent for a long time...and many more similar examples.</TEXT>

I just wonder how, say, halfway through the next season, I could conceivably tell my (non-book-reading) parents "nah it's good just stick with it" when basically things from here on out more-or-less "start over" in terms of tearing down old heroes, building up new ones, blah blah blah.</TEXT>

Edit: **TL;DR** - The *huge* changes that occur in books 4-5...I just wonder if TV followers can really follow along with that, because (to me) these sorts of changes are the type that those with short memories/attention spans won't really care for/pay attention to.</TEXT>

4) Let's assume they do precisely that - burn all their timeouts and block the field goal, which barring a fluke fumble, is their only chance at all by this point.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1193_1452_25</DOCNO>

Fourth - Generally speaking the song is somewhere between "rock" and "electronic"...it has a very party vibe kinda feel to it...it's kinda "noisy" in that most frequencies are spoken for by one sorta noise or another...

Finally - the song is maybe 3-5 years old?</TEXT>

* New one here after playing more - the creeps in this game seem...kinda pointless...there just seems to be so much constant moving, spending a few seconds to take a control point then moving for a gank or another control point...it seems that laning in a traditional Moba is something you shouldn't really do in this game.</TEXT>

As a disclaimer of sorts - there are only two novels by Neal Stephenson that I have read less than three times - The Big U (which I just completed for the second time), and The System of the World, the final chapter of the Baroque Cycle, which I am currently working my second way through and which brings me to this post.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> 

But this third book ("System of the World") I am struggling with, for the reasons laid out below - 

1) It seems Stephenson decided he would create three ~1,000 page works and set out to achieve that goal, regardless of the pacing/style/"interestingness" of the work.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1193_1492_6</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

2) I find myself skipping over large sections of this work because of that, which is something I very infrequently do.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1193_1492_7</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> I reach a point where I see that the next ~4 pages are simply long paragraphs describing what London/(insert setting) looked like at the time, or similar, and I ignore those parts until I start seeing quotes again, signifying a return to plot.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1193_1492_8</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

3) Even those parts with quotations/"plot" involved frequently seem to be large diversions simply to fill page numbers.</TEXT>

These novels take place in (respectively); ~1940-1945 and 1999ish, ~1680-1750ish, 2020ish, 1998ish, somewhere between 2050-2080ish, and current day and 2100ish.</TEXT>

Myself and xrelaht [his comments that inspired this thread here](http://www.reddit.com/r/books/comments/12u65p/its_not_often_i_read_a_1000_page_book_for_the/c6ymbmv?context=3) believe all of these novels exist in the same universe for the following reasons (that link leads to the reasons, but to explain them here) -

1) First, nothing in any novel inherently counters another novel's "universe" from existing.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1193_1593_6</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> For a random instance, there isn't a mention of, say, London being nuked, while another novel has London still existing.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> 

2a) There are specific examples, primarily identified by xrehalt - in the Diamond Age, a very elderly woman mentions she was a "thrasher" when she was younger; Y.T. in Snow Crash is known as a thrasher.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1193_1593_10</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

2b) In Reamde, a character refers to an inflatable boat as a "zodiac", which isn't a common term for such a thing; however, in his novel Zodiac, inflatable boats are frequently used.</TEXT>

3a) More vaguely related; China.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1193_1593_15</DOCNO>

3b) Cryptonomicon involves the creation of a legitimate digital currency.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1193_1593_16</DOCNO>

            	<DOCNO>s_1193_1593_17</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

3c) Similarly, Snow Crash involves a pretty liberal/"free" society; the Diamond Age features a Neo-Victorian society.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1193_1593_18</DOCNO>

            	<DOCNO>s_1193_1593_19</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> Thus, the Neo-Victorian attitudes in Diamond Age are more easily understood, as they're a backlash to the ultra-freedom in Snow Crash.</TEXT>

The only novels to take place in a remotely similar period of time are Zodiac and Reamde, and parts of Cryptonomicon - and again, none of these make reference to something that obviously precludes them from sharing the same universe.</TEXT>

There are three main story-lines, with a few others that spring up later - one set in World War 2, following a math genius and Nazi code-breaking; another set in World War 2, the jarhead Marine whose duty is to make SNAFU's look normal (while kicking ass along the way); and the final a modern day character attempting to...well...I don't want to spoil things.</TEXT>

If the SD media had half the backbone of the NY media (or Pitt, or Balt, or NE, or many others), Norv would have been fired two or three years ago and we might have a decent coach by now.</TEXT>

Instead, Norv will be fired (probably not) in mid-season, we'll have an interim coach who will struggle through the middle of next season, and by the time we have a good coach with a strong mindset, Rivers will be too old and/or to worn out, and it will be complete rebuilding mode.</TEXT>

So the things I'm wondering about - 

Regarding the table, if I just, say, use some screws to connect the metal supports for the glass surface, is this wood so much more likely to deform (since it still has a higher moisture content) that it will eventually pop out the screws?</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1193_1679_12</DOCNO>

For the log flower pot idea, similarly, can I apply a thick enough varnish/lacquer/whatever on the surfaces that house the plant (drilling holes to provide drainage), that the water from watering the plants won't harm the wood?</TEXT>

Okay, so in the book, Tyrion uses a great big chain to catch a bunch of ships in his wildfire trap.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>

3) I was about to throw in stats for W-L against common opponents, but that's probably the hardest to sort through, and certain trends were becoming pretty apparent anyway.</TEXT>
