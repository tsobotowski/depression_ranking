**Abstract**

Abrupt perturbations of the global carbon cycle during the early Eocene are associated with rapid global warming events, which are analogous in many ways to present greenhouse warming.</TEXT>

**In a nutshell**:

\- Coastal wetlands sequester substantial amounts of carbon, mostly in soils

\- Interest in the climate benefits of coastal wetlands has drawn attention to how other components of marine ecosystems might play a role in climate mitigation

\- Coral reefs, kelp, and marine fauna, while important components of carbon cycling in the ocean, are not involved in long-term carbon sequestration

\- Due to jurisdictional issues, practical management of coral, phytoplankton, kelp, and marine fauna within climate mitigation frameworks would be difficult

\- Current climate mitigation efforts in the coastal and marine realm should focus primarily on coastal wetlands, as they represent long-term carbon sinks and potential carbon sources upon conversion, and can be managed for their carbon sequestration value</TEXT>

___

**Highlights**

 \- Tardigrade intrinsically disordered proteins (TDPs) are enriched during desiccation

 \- TDPs are required for tardigrades to survive desiccation

 \- Expression of TDPs increases desiccation tolerance in heterologous systems

 \- TDPs vitrify, and this vitrified state mirrors their protective capabilities

**Summary**

Tardigrades are microscopic animals that survive a remarkable array of stresses, including desiccation.</TEXT>

**Abstract**

**Abstract**

We present an energy balance analysis of the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) in a 100% 
renewable energy scenario
 in which wind and photovoltaics (PV) provides 90% of the annual electricity

            	<TEXT>
The key outcome 
of our modelling 
is that the 
additional 
cost of balancing renewable 
energy
 supply
 with
demand 
on an hourly basis 
throughout the year is modest: AU$25
-30/MWh
 (US$19-
23/MWh)

In our modelling we avoid heroic assumptions about future technology development
 by only including 
technology that has already been deployed in large quantities ( 100 Gigawatts), namely PV, wind, high 
voltage 
transmission
 (HVDC, HVAC) and pumped hydro energy storage (PHES).</TEXT>

As the report states:

The many attempts that have been made to estimate carbon payback periods suggest that they vary substantially, from less than 20 years to many decades, and in some cases even centuries... It can be argued that the length of the carbon payback period does not matter as long as all emissions are eventually absorbed.</TEXT>

A number of studies have recently been published suggesting that limiting increased warming to 2C relative to pre-industrial may be unattainable without stronger policies, rapid decarbonization, and  negative emissions through the implementation of carbon capture and storage (a technological and economical feat we have yet to achieve at appropriate scales), while others suggest 2C warming may already be locked in, depending on equilibrium climate sensitivity values.</TEXT>

- Relative influences of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation and ENSO on the South Pacific Convergence Zone^[2](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2001GL014201/full)

A general summary concerning the IPO can be found here: http://climatology.co.uk/interdecadal-pacific-oscillation

The paper suggests that we may be transitioning to a positive phase IPO (represented [here](http://i.imgur.com/XEo571a.jpg) by the smoothed line)^[3](https://www.longpaddock.qld.gov.au/products/australiasvariableclimate/), ^[4](https://www.esrl.noaa.gov/psd/data/timeseries/IPOTPI/), ^[5](http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/hadobs/)

Natural cycles in orbital parameters, known as Milankovitch cycles, indicate that the Earth should be entering a cooling phase - a glacial period - however, it has been well established that under recent Earth system conditions atmospheric CO2 must fall below at least 280ppm to initiate the onset of a glacial period.</TEXT>

RCP2.6 | Peak in radiative forcing at ~3 W/m2 (~490 ppm CO2 eq) before 2100 and then decline (the selected pathway declines to 2.6 W/m2 by 2100) |

...our results suggest that if, by mitigation measures, CO2 levels are kept well below those projected by the business-as-usual RCP8.5 scenario, the effect of GrIS mass loss on the AMOC strength will likely remain limited and an AMOC collapse, and its potentially dangerous impacts, is very unlikely.</TEXT>

Study (open access): [Interpreting palaeofire evidence from fluvial sediments: a case study from Santa Rosa Island, California, with implications for the Younger Dryas Impact Hypothesis](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jqs.2914/full)

**Abstract**:

Fluvial sequences from the late Pleistocene to the Holocene are exposed in Arlington Canyon, Santa Rosa Island, Northern Channel Islands, California, USA, including one outcrop that features centrally in the controversial hypothesis of an extra-terrestrial impact at the onset of the Younger Dryas.</TEXT>

We're looking to use the following formula so we also need the density of glacial ice: 0.9167 kg/m^3 or 0.9167 Gt/km^3

Mass of ice (Gt) = Volume of ice (km3) x Density of ice (Gt/km3) 

 `Mass of ice (Gt) = 3461 km^3 x 0.9167 Gt/km^3 = 3172.7 Gt (metric gigatons)`

Study: [A persistent and dynamic East Greenland Ice Sheet over the past 7.5 million years](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v540/n7632/full/nature20147.html)
___

**Abstract**:

Climate models show that ice-sheet melt will dominate sea-level rise over the coming centuries, but our understanding of ice-sheet variations before the last interglacial 125,000 years ago remains fragmentary.</TEXT>

Study: [Reorientation of Sputnik Planitia implies a subsurface ocean on Pluto](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature20148.html)

While the data Zwally used only extended to 2008 he did have the following to say: 

Were essentially in agreement with other studies that show an increase in ice discharge in the Antarctic Peninsula and the Thwaites and Pine Island region of West Antarctica, said Jay Zwally... Our main disagreement is for East Antarctica and the interior of West Antarctica  there, we see an ice gain that exceeds the losses in the other areas.</TEXT>

Of course there are more kinds of corrections (see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UAH_satellite_temperature_dataset ) but the point I'm making is that data sets *must* be adjusted and there are many methods by which to do this depending on the type of data (for example: [homogenization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homogenization_(climate)).</TEXT>

While the data Zwally used only extended to 2008 he did have the following to say: 

Were essentially in agreement with other studies that show an increase in ice discharge in the Antarctic Peninsula and the Thwaites and Pine Island region of West Antarctica, said Jay Zwally... Our main disagreement is for East Antarctica and the interior of West Antarctica  there, we see an ice gain that exceeds the losses in the other areas.</TEXT>

**Abstract**:

The early evolution of planetesimals and planets can be constrained using variations in the abundance of neodymium-142 (142Nd), which arise from the initial distribution of 142Nd within the protoplanetary disk and the radioactive decay of the short-lived samarium-146 isotope (146Sm).</TEXT>

...that means cheap natural gas is not just replacing coal, but solar and wind, too...

Hausfather briefly touches on this in the article stating, "*But if we end up locking in gas infrastructure that sticks around and delays renewables, we might be better off eschewing a gas bridge even if it means sticking around with coal a bit longer.*"</TEXT>

From the conclusions of the study:

In a context of a global warming of 2 K, a perturbed high-resolution model simulation indicates that the morphological properties of TMLCs [thin mid-level clouds], as well as their cloud water content, and thus their OD, remain similar.</TEXT>

If life emerged before 4.1 Ga, the amount of land may have been **confined to island arcs**...

Island arcs require plate tectonics, and while there is a good degree of debate surrounding the origin of modern plate tectonics (opposed to [drip tectonics](https://speakingofgeoscience.org/2013/04/28/when-did-plate-tectonics-begin-on-earth-and-what-came-before/)) I don't believe there is sufficient evidence to suggest modern plate tectonics 4.1 Ga.
