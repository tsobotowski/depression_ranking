            	<TEXT>These are the cards that interact with graveyards/exile (where it actually matters what kind of card they are) - common - **[[dutiful return]]** - black - return 2 creatures from graveyard to hand **[[mortuary mire]]** - land (black mana) - on etb put a creature from your graveyard on top of your library uncommon - **[[crumble to dust]]** - red - this will probably never matter (but it exiles all nonbasic lands with the same name as the target) **[[deathless behemoth]]** - colorless - sac 2 eldrazi scion to bring him from the graveyard to your hand **[[halimar tidecaller]]** - blue - return a spell with awaken to your hand **[[stasis snare]]** - white - exile creature until this leaves play **[[ulamog's reclaimer]]** - blue - can return an instant or sorcery to hand rare/mythic - **[[akoum firebird]]** - red - landfall pay 6 to return it to the battlefield **[[aligned hedron network]]** - colorless - exile creatures with power  gt; 4 until this leaves play **[[emeria shepherd]]** - white - landfall - bring a permanent back from the graveyard into your hand or onto the battlefield **[[greenwarden of murasa]]** - green - on entering and leaving the battlefield he can bring any card to your hand **[[march from the tomb]]** - white/black - return up to 8 cmc of ally creatures to the battlefield **[[oblivion sower]]** - colorless - steals lands from opponent's exile **[[quarantine field]]** - white - exile creatures until this leaves play Here's some takeaways - * If you're playing against black, try to return lands and non-creature (especially non-ally) spells, since they have ways to return creatures * If you're playing against blue, try to return lands, creatures, and spells without awaken * Against white, try to return non-permanents, or their worst cards * Against green, try to return their worst cards * If you have oblivion sower, try to hold off on returning lands, since you can steal them even if he didn't exile them * Weigh your chances of being able to get your creatures back from oblivion ring type effects vs the benefit of processing those cards * Returning akoum firebird or deathless behemoth to your opponent's graveyard is probably a bad idea Take that advice with a grain of salt, and let me know if I missed anything.</TEXT>
