Uhh, I guess some more stuff so I seem interesting... I went to Europe in March, I love Harry Potter, the building I'm in is tall, I'm near the top, and it's windy, so there are a lot of ominous creaking noises... I liked a pizza I had in England better than one I had in Italy, but they were all delicious.</TEXT>
