            	<TEXT> Then again you also have the mild issue around things like EU support, arguably Paul Blomfield has a decent advantage there, he campaigned heavily for leave, has been visible on the issues and is now on the Shadow brexit team making it clear that he wants the UK to leave on good terms... All in it's not a clear picture, but I don't think the Greens in Sheffield will see significant improvements as it stands, I think they'd have done better if they had managed to keep hold of Jillian Creasy as a candidate in terms of credibility and presence, and I sort of wonder if this election is going to make it harder for the Greens to really campaign on their issues.</TEXT>

I doubt that they will be much closer in Sheffield, Jillian Creasy had a fairly large personal following, parachuting Natalie Bennett in may sound good, but I'm not sure it'll do what the Greens want it to (although I may be a bit biased, I thought Jillian Creasy was pretty good, and I've seen her outside of election periods, I've only seen Natalie Bennett on TV and she hasn't really impressed..).</TEXT>

However one of the other guys I know with one has been saying that essentially it has caused no end of issues with reboots and problems with battery saving stuff just not working.. This is the same hardware, now running the same OS, the only differences can be in terms of apps and some config options.. Which doesn't seem like it'd be enough to create such wildly different experiences..

I think there is an update due fairly soon to address some of the reported problems, I really hope it does because I really like my phone and it has worked well so far.</TEXT>

Personally I think work at that age is useful in developmental terms, you work with people who are older than you, understand that you get paid, get to make choices about money you have earned etc..

That said, I get the impression that a lot of what the EU is talking about is for internal EU consumption, or rather I hope it is, because nothing that has come out so far really looks to help the EU position, but instead seems to be causing more of a rift (that May is exploiting rather than suffering from).</TEXT>

They know it means leaving the EU.. The question was whether the UK should be in the EU or out of it, everything beyond is up for debate and negotiation... It's a bit like suggesting that no-one really knows the implications of voting Labour or Tory in a general election, because you don't know whether they will have an absolute majority, or end up in a coalition, whether they will drop a pledge, or do something unexpected etc..

The referendum set a direction, that was to leave the EU, everything else about that is essentially up for grabs.</TEXT>

A new referendum isn't going to solve that either, because frankly even at the end of the negotiations there are going to be disputes about the impact of the resultant agreement, questions about future trade deals etc.. I think /u/aoide12's point is that we've had a referendum, the government and much of parliament has resolved to take the UK out of the EU, so that should happen at this point, rather than asking the country if they are really sure..</TEXT>

In short, if the US can't muscle it's way into trade dominance through treaties (rather than simply sheer capacity) the EU, which has not been very good at leveraging soft power at the best of times isn't going to be able to force the issue with what will be a fairly major regional power..

I have no idea what you are talking about here now.. Neither the UK, nor Poland had help from the EU in rebuilding after WWII if that's what you are referencing, both went through some modernisation whilst in the EU (and both went through some before membership too for that matter..) but Poland was in a far worse state on joining than the UK was and it saw significant benefits in a reasonably short period of time...

You can create scenario's where Poland does better outside of the EU than inside it, not massively credibly, but I suppose you could.. The point however is that Poland has seen significant benefits from EU membership, it's much harder to argue that Poland could have done better outside, because it has done very well in the EU.</TEXT>

The concern really is around how the EU approaches these draft proposals and develops them, there is a lot of pressure from the likes of France to take a more protectionist approach (and IIRC France had exchange controls on the Franc up until 1990..) without the balancing effect of the UK, although in this area Germany is fairly sane too so...

If you take say social class as a guide, instead of age or level of education, it reduces the amount of skew by quite a bit:

AB went 59% for remain, C1 closer to 52% C2 went 62% for leave and DE 54% leave.</TEXT>

Compare that to the point about 70% of degree holders voting remain and 70% or those with no qualifications voting leave which seems to correlate far more closely with age (under 34 vs over 55's..) than with anything else..  </TEXT>

            	<TEXT> Had something similar (almost) happen a year and a bit ago when I was running a little stall where we were giving away random merch to people we were speaking to, all on behalf of a tiny community advocacy group, at a civil liberties convention (think small, a few speakers, a few workshops and maybe 1000 people).</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>The stall had the usual stuff, pens, posters, mugs, wrist bands, caps, small USB sticks and some T-shirts IIRC and lots of brochures style information for people to get a better idea of what the group did and so on.</TEXT>

There were about three of us chatting to people, getting contact details, some donations, and I think there was a petition involved, but that may have been a different event.. Anyway, our little table was covered in promotional material, we'd been at it for a few hours but the event was still quite busy, all in all a good day.</TEXT>

As I'm talking to a guy I see a woman walk over pick up one of the leaflets and read though it, so as I finish I pop over to her and ask if there is anything she'd like to know or if she's happy reading and she stops, looks up and asks how much our mugs are.</TEXT>

Now normally people would ask about a specific thing in the leaflets, or ask about the stuff that the group did, occasionally they'd ask for a specific one of the posters or similar but I don't think anyone had asked about pricing for the bits we were giving away.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>I was a tiny bit taken aback so I sort of watched in fascination for maybe 15 seconds as she tries to pack these mugs into a bag that's already basically full of them..  10 seconds in she bends down and grabs the box of extra mugs that we have sat under the table (maybe another 10-12 mugs..) and starts to try and arrange the mugs she can't get into her handbag into the box..

At that point I went over again and asked her what she was doing and the conversation wend something like:

Me:  Excuse me, you can't take all of those..

Her: Why?</TEXT>

I think all the more reasonable suggestions that I've seen would mean that an independent Scotland would be a (small) net contributor to the EU, not a net recipient of funds, I think your farmers would be better off via agricultural funding, but if Scotland were a net contributor that's obviously just a movement of Scottish funding around anyway and then ring-fenced for farming by the EU.</TEXT>

Of course not, but joining the EU now is very different than joining the EEC in 1973, many of the things that the UK had opt outs on likely wouldn't be opt-outable of so you'd not only have to convince people that EU membership was the right move, but also defend against the suggestion that the UK would lose the pound, have to join Schengen and potentially a whole raft of other things that are genuinely unpopular in the UK (like an EU Army etc..).</TEXT>

I'd take that a little further too, there seems to be (again, on a council by council basis..) a massive rush toward signage that isn't appropriate, huge 'Slow' warnings, and chevrons before corners that can safely be driven at the speed limit cause people to slow unnecessarily and lull people into a false sense of security when they come to a corner that actually does require you to slow down significantly for.</TEXT>

That's true, and the US is somewhat interesting because most of it's government departments are far more politicised than in other countries, so I can imagine there being shenanigans and posturing in a way that wouldn't be as likely in say Germany..

Sort of.. It does the job in indicating the difference in access either way, you could do it by head of population, but you'd be ignoring several aspects (foreign students and demographics - there are far more 'older' people now etc..) and in any case, looking at annual award rates doesn't fully show the skew in the proportion of degree qualified people in the population at any given point (i.e, it's massively higher than even the numbers below would suggest after 1992 because of the cumulative effect..).</TEXT>

In short though, it comes down to the fact that you can't really use the referendum as a guide to the Election, and that the issues are far more complex than remaining or leaving the EU (and I'd assume that the EU will, as it usually is, be far less important to most people than a slew of other issues..).</TEXT>

We merged the state with religion, have bishops in the Lords, prayers before meetings, state sanctioned religion in schools and I think partially because of that, and more, we treat religion as an unimportant cultural addon that's sort of nice, no-one actually believes in any of it, but we know the words to some of the songs, and the ideas are non-threatening, and frankly we occasionally wonder if the priests actually believe in god..

The US on the other hand has strict separation, no religion in schools, protests against prayers near meetings and as a result, they have people screaming about religious persecution, religion being vital in politics, visible religiosity being demanded, violent anti-abortion events on the back of religion, mega-churches that both fuel more religiosity and drag in money from people who can least afford it and so on..

We essentially made religion irrelevant by making it less about faith and more about culture and politics, that seems to work quite well...</TEXT>

Yes.. But there is quite a bit of popular support for it.. 47% of people in the UK would like to see legalisation, 39% don't.. It's not a fringe issue (again, you don't have to look far to find people who support legalisation, and many of them in the centre ground when it comes to politics, but you'd have to look quite hard to find a major party supporting it..).</TEXT>

There are or at least use to be many people who would say yes in a poll to pretty much any referendum...

That's slightly misleading though, essentially that's polling to suggest that people would like to have a say in things, but broadly people don't call for them, and the UK doesn't have them on minor issues..

Personally, I was against it when it was first announced so you can't accuse me of opposing it just because I didn't get the result that I wanted.</TEXT>

You'll note I haven't..

It was David Cameron who pushed for it and he managed to convince people from other parties to vote for it..

The point is that our representatives, the ones we elected, overwhelmingly voted to give people a choice on this issue, in part because one side of the argument was poorly represented.</TEXT>

That's not how I saw it in the UK, although of course my view will likely be different from other peoples.. The issue started to come up in lots of related areas (doing some work in TTIP it came up again and again..), there was certainly more focus on Europe, people became more aware of what was going on and informed themselves about the EU (which both helped cement opposition and support...).</TEXT>

That's a slightly bizarre statement, the EU can't really 'put the UK in it's place' at best it can offer a shitty deal that the UK can't take, but under any scenario the EU isn't in a position where it could threaten the survival of the UK..

The sensible scenario is still a deal that provides as much benefit to both sides as possible.</TEXT>

I think the problem is that the stated aim is dealing with IS, but that has morphed into very limited action by everyone involved, bar the Syrian government and Russia who have been prioritising recapturing the country, with fighting IS being a bit of a sideline (and then there is Turkey doing its thing too, and Iran for that matter).</TEXT>

France and the UK do act unilaterally when their interests are at stake, they can't act unilaterally in Syria though, given they'd be stepping on both the US's and Russia's toes.. The remainder of the EU can't really act unilaterally as they aren't that capable..

Yeah, it's cheaper than tobacco and has been for a long time, but you go through massively more liquid if you produce a lot of vapour in my experience, so a bottle that'd cost you 7 or around that will last a few days rather than a week and a bit or more..

I'm really not sure it does, or rather, that there is a point where it doesn't get any better and you are essentially just producing excess vapour.. As to battery life and liquid, I've got 1800mah in battery capacity that lasts 2-3 days and go through 15ml (at 7..) in about two weeks, if not more (depends on usage obviously..) and I played around with resistance, voltages, and liquid mixes quite a bit..</TEXT>

I'd assume it is intended to suggest that the chemical attack from last week was not a government attack (a lot of the arguments seem to be that the Syrian government is the only group capable of launching such an attack if that isn't the case, you'd need to also look at who else could have, or would have wanted to carry out such an attack..).</TEXT>

What I would like to know is what on earth those old French Renault Twingo's (like 2001 vintage) have under the bonnet, We got repeatedly overtaken by them on the French motorways (en route to Luxembourg and indeed on the way back after leaving Belgium etc..) when we really weren't going slowly.. at all.. The other common denominator was that the drivers all seemed to have their arms hanging out of their windows (and who has open windows when you are bombing down a motorway..?!)</TEXT>

I'm not sure there would be a lot of political fallout from China and Russia in this particular scenario, that said even if there were none, I doubt the US would want to use nuclear weapons simply because of the humanitarian impact, you can't exactly use them and not kill a huge number of people, and as much as Trump is a bit of a dick, I think he'd stop short of killing a vast number of people who are essentially victims of the same regime.</TEXT>

It wouldn't, unless they did it all the time and prevented a large number of people from registering, and even then it wouldn't really work (because most people are registered to vote anyway, and you get a letter regularly to keep that up to date that you post back...) and would be far more obvious and difficult than taking a site down for a few hours.</TEXT>

Not really,  higher education isn't *that* expensive in the first place, shifting the cost on to a smaller group of people (graduates or students..) arguably relies more on having that group be able to pay given you'd be pushing the burden across a smaller population..

If every Tom, Dick and Harry can rack up bills for 40,000-50,000 on Underwater Wanking Science Studies, then it does nothing to improve the wealth of the tax base and becomes an extravagant expense.</TEXT>

Sort of (although I think it'd be hard to get people outside of the US to see that as valid, as there tend to be somewhat tighter rules of engagement for the police, not that that always prevents issues, but it mostly does..) I'd be worried that that shifts the blame away from the police and their responsibility to use reasonable force though..

There is almost no chance that the US would be able to defend against even a small launch from China or Russia because you'd be talking about an enemy capable of launching quite a few missiles, with quite a few modern, manoeuvrable warheads per missile, and incorporating penetration aids and decoys etc.. The various elements of the US missile defence system are great, but they don't come close to offering anything approaching blanket protection against ICBMs, in fact what there is is not really geared toward intercepting large numbers of modern ICBM's and has a low success rate against simpler targets...

Don't get me wrong, what the US has achieved is phenomenal, but it's a very long way away from being able to defend well against a modern threat.</TEXT>

Sort of, various countries have started adding descriptive rules to tax policy (so they state why a rule is being implemented, so using it for something else is more obviously a breach of the rules) so it becomes easier to determine impact and potential for abuse without having to go into massive detail..  Still, you have to start somewhere.</TEXT>

To be honest I'd actually like to see the legislative aspect of avoidance being dealt with first (either through simplification or simply a review..), that way you would hopefully improve the success rate of your enforcement agencies when it comes to evasion and fraud, although that might throw up other issues around dealing with 'legacy' offences in the previous system.</TEXT>

Right..

So, we deal with evasion and fraud by using the law enforcement agencies we have and work to detect and prosecute criminality.. But when it comes to avoidance, it is not about stopping it, but making sure that governments do not take the piss when they write tax laws, it's essentially something you argue for or against (like the shape, scale and type of welfare payments or defence policy etc..) rather than fight against generally.</TEXT>

Except governments often use tax incentives to get companies to do things that they like, you get to avoid or reduce your taxes by doing something that the government wants doing, that is beneficial (hopefully..) to society.. Surely that still fits into that in terms of distributing burdens..

The solution is also the same, make it more difficult to engage in all three behaviors by tightening laws and strengthening oversight.</TEXT>

It's not a fallacy, but you do have to be aware what 'broke' means

you are spending a fortune on maintenance and downtime while you look for parts

That generally justifies an upgrade, when it costs more to run whatever you are running, than running an upgraded version, it's broken..

plus now it's a security nightmare

That also constitutes broken, although old doesn't always mean insecure, depends on the system and the threats

It will fucking break for good at some point and you'll be running around in panic mode for weeks or months and losing more money in the process.</TEXT>

The ~~byline~~ subheading alone is somewhat telling - *If what you mean by Brexit is the UK severing all ties to the EU to reclaim our sovereignty and take back control of our borders, then it isnt likely at all*

The idea that the UK has to sever all ties, and take some extreme position on everything in relation to the EU seems to be becoming more common, but it broadly doesn't seem to be coming from the bulk of people who voted leave.</TEXT>

Now granted the article does a bit to refight the referendum and immediate aftermath:

*The problem is that often when people talk about leaving the EU they confuse it with leaving the EEA (European Economic Area) and its single market  but not all EEA states are in the EU.</TEXT>

I think the various conflicts that leaving the EU but remaining in the EEA have already been broadly discussed, and indeed the government has been somewhat clear on both leaving the single movement, and the customs union, it seems unlikely that the UK would want to, or will follow anything that looks like the Norwegian model..

And then we finish with:

Of course that assumes a few things, most importantly that the freelancer has the right to assign ownership (if they used liberally licensed content they might not be able to..)...

So that seems to deal with both 1 and 2, as to three, if the above applies then you'd stop in the same way that you'd prevent anyone else from infringing on your copyrights, (that depends on jurisdiction, but broadly comes down to asking them not to, and taking them to court if they don't comply...).</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>What about Italy, with services at 75% of GDP, or the Netherlands at 80%...  Germany is a massive manufacturer and exporting country, it is the exception not the norm and the UK has a services sector only 9% larger, but of course the UK also exports far more in the way of services than Germany.</TEXT>

In any case, the idea that the UK *'has very little in terms of a producing goods economy left'* is bizarre under both assumptions, the UK went through a period of massively reducing it's heavy industry, which was frankly very damaging in my view, but it didn't get rid of manufacturing, it changed what it manufactured.</TEXT>

For example,  why produce steel when Germany subsidised it's industry and produces it much more cheaply, same with China.. At that point you can buy steel to produce finished goods (cheaper inputs, no need to subsidise heavy industry and compete with China or Germany on steel exports..) or focus on specialist metallurgy instead (do something that China and Germany can't do - see the UKs unique position in the supply of materials to things like the US nuclear submarine programme..).</TEXT>

The UK absolutely still produces goods and exports them, it produces a lot of goods for both export and domestic consumption, the idea that the UK doesn't produce anything anymore is a misconception based on a couple of strands (the reduction in heavy industry and the loss of mass employers through both automation and modernisation as well as competition) that don't actually lead to that as a conclusion.</TEXT>

One of those silly things really, I absolutely can see the benefits of federalism for the EU, in the very least of closer integration, but absolutely don't think the UK should be a part of that and I certainly don't want it for the UK, so it becomes an argument for leaving (ever closer union and integration is how you solve some of the EU's problems, if you don't want ever closer union, membership itself is problematic..).</TEXT>

You could argue that this then starts to mirror the notion that the EU fracturing is a threat to peace and stability (That is to say that NATO fracturing is absolutely a potential threat to peace and stability) but with people pushing for it anyway, largely because they see the argument as invalid and have their own theory.</TEXT>

That was my run up to school this morning, on the way up it seemed like the lights weren't changing at all (sat for about 5 minutes before someone took the initiative and just went..) quite a lot of the  drivers were just going for it.. But it meant a lot of traffic on Walkley road down and South road back just sitting..

A lass who was walking up the road stopped, watched for a bit and then started directing the traffic, when I came back down again half an hour later, there was a chap doing the same thing, and he looked like he was handing or about to head off after I passed him.. So cheer if that was you anyway.</TEXT>

Oh and the size limits are also interesting, we found a civil war canon ball a while ago with a diameter of around 2 inches, likely fired by a falconet (a civil war cannon) which would have a barrel length of around 48 inches.. Curious to think that you could own something that could fire it under the regs..

Oh and video about the ownership of cannons without any footage of a cannon.. Come on!</TEXT>

I wasn't aware that EU membership required blind adherence to any particular dogma.. Surely if Hungary, has a different view of what the EU should be (whether you, I or anyone else agrees with that or not) then they have every right to push for that view.. It's a union of sovereign states after all, not a religion.</TEXT>

That'll be costly for Labour in upcoming elections, and potentially a bit of a boon to the Lib Dems too, but I do wonder to what degree.</TEXT>

All that said, I don't think that the Lib Dems seem very centrist when it comes to the EU, and there are some severe limits on how far the Lib Dems can push their current position without looking a bit daft, right now I'd argue that they would have a very hard time convincing anyone who voted leave that they were a safe pair of hands to negotiate or carry out an exit from the EU.</TEXT>

With that in mind, I'm not sure that the Lib Dems are the best party to fight a Tory hard brexit, it's the equivalent of going to the far left against a Tory government, it cedes the centre ground, it doesn't occupy it.</TEXT>

That's true of most things, but that doesn't mean we shouldn't talk about it now..

The really antagonising element there is the lack of a war in any declared sense, we spent a lot of time over the centuries figuring out how we thought rules could be applied and people held to account, and then essentially watched almost everyone simply ignore it by avoiding declared wars and the responsibilities that come with it.. The public reaction is sometimes interesting in that regard too, not sure if you will have seen it, but a Marine in the UK was recently in court because he shot a shot Taliban insurgent under conditions that were not justifiable, the reporting and commentary was.. interesting.</TEXT>

He's the president, he should either know how these systems work, or employ someone who does to be responsible to him on them..

He is being sued, and he has a hand in it (not the initial listing, but the continued threat), in that he is now responsible for the fuckup by the Obama administration, it goes with the job..

I read it, I'm pointing out that Trump is being sued so the headline is accurate, but not comprehensive, the article however is fairly comprehensive... At the end of the day it's a headline (and not my headline at that..), you do sort of have to read the rest of it to understand what is going on in full.</TEXT>

As to fucking with people for political reasons, I'm far more interested in the whole 'being placed on 'kill-list' by mistake' bit, than Obama being responsible for the names being added, or Trump being named as he is currently responsible..

Now my ideal solution would be for them to simply add attribution, if they want to sell them, that's fine with me even if I'm not getting a cut (so far it's all about images I want out there without a cost anyway) but that doesn't seem to be a possibility.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> I ended up having a chat on the train with a random passenger whose laptop bore the same damage as many of mine so I thought I'd share:

I've been using and looking after a small fleet of X2xx's (first 200's and 201s, now 220's and 230's) and one thing that I noticed early was that if you had nothing in the cardslot, inevitably cracks develop.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1619_1422_2</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Now you can replace the palmrest easily enough, and you can keep doing that as it happens again and again but it seems a bit silly, so way back when I decided to grab the cheapest card available (USB ports, smart card reader etc.. I'd love a blank but they don't seem to exist..) and keep it in the machine.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1619_1422_3</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> No more cracks, no more breakage, no more replacing the palmrest.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1619_1422_4</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Anyway, thought it might be useful to someone here, although given it's incredibly obvious I'm sure I'm not the only one... Or maybe my kit just ends up getting more abuse..

Watching the various debates and the Sky Q A session from today, I find myself (probably not unsurprisingly..) very much in support of the sentiment that Jeremy is putting forward on the EU, just not the position it is supposed to support.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1619_1487_3</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

The Sky Q A really hit home that I'm essentially taking a leave position on issues that Jeremy also seems to be pretty concerned with, I'd probably scatter some concerns about the fact that if we leave, and do see significant reform (not that I think that terribly likely..), it'll be Tory led reform that goes in the opposite direction that I'd prefer

A socially positive, progressive EU that works for everyone, ensures that governments can act on behalf of their people, that promotes an open and just society and protects the weakest would be great, but it doesn't seem possible.</TEXT>

And yes, I recognise that there will likely be a near term economic cost to leaving the EU, and no, I'm not terribly happy with the idea of a future government pushing hard to utterly dismantle free movement either, but the risk the EU poses, and the benefits of being able to act outside the EU without being linked to the project in its current form (and potentially after another round of integration..) seem to balance that out.</TEXT>

We go to vote on Thursday, and result aside, I think everyone involved has done a pretty crappy job of both pushing the debate and making their respective cases, even on the doorstep the arguments have been less than stellar, and that's one area where you do have time to have a bit of a conversation.</TEXT>

Anyway, I'd just like to add that I like the idea of Jeremy's EU, I don't think we can build it out of what we have at the moment, so maybe if we leave we should talk about how we go about building something like that in the UK, and then beyond..</TEXT>

Anyway, first things first, the wileyfox case obviously doesn't protect the screen in any way (it doesn't extend past the  front of the phone) although I think it does make the phone easier to hold (and looks good..) I do wonder if without the case it might have fallen more randomly and not landed flat, but hey, not the cases fault.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> So, I saw that a few people had issues with the update, and quite a few others didn't see much difference afterwards, so I thought I'd throw in a quick (and positive) observation on battery life.</TEXT>

I only switched to the Swift a while ago and was pleased at the battery life compared to my older LG (which had a relatively new after-market battery in..), essentially I went from having to charge my phone briefly during the day to it lasting from when I got up, to when I went to bed.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1619_1518_5</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

However since the update, the amount of power being used by the phone when it's asleep seems to have fallen quite dramatically (based on the power usage graphs anyway).</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>

Given I get notifications via KDEconnect on my laptop the phone does appear to have been doing it's thing with emails and so, it's been hooked to my company VOIP all day too, and I've had it in my hand more often than I would have my old LG (mostly because it has been dying slowly..) but it's looking like the 'standby' periods have been quite a lot less draining than previously.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1619_1518_8</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Now, obviously it's a correlation, and I'll see what it looks like over the week, but even a moderate improvement in battery usage when the phone isn't directly being used would be a huge boost..

Anyway, keeps me happy, has anyone else noticed anything interesting?</TEXT>

However, given I have a nice new phone that's running what appears to be a solid OS, and a promise I've made not to mess with it (so that I have it in a working condition all the time...) mean I've hit a mild issue in that the apk I have for Eleven, whilst working, results in semi regular crashes during playback and general unhappiness.</TEXT>

I lead that effort and thought I'd share a few things.</TEXT>

Firstly, what we needed.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1619_1628_4</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> It probably won't surprise anyone here, but the requirements for something that can be volunteer built, run and managed but also be the core of a political parties IT infrastructure are pretty complex.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1619_1628_5</DOCNO>

We needed something that first and foremost was a CMS, its all about the content!</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1619_1628_6</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>but it also had to be capable of a few other things too, not least managing our membership, handling mails outs for subscribers members and press, running internal elections, taking payments and donations (and reporting them sensibly), promoting events, and a whole host of other things.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>

We also made a decision that for the build we wanted to do as little coding as possible - not because we didn't have the skills in house, or volunteers who desperately wanted to write code, but because we wanted something maintainable and easy to get people to transition on to.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1619_1628_9</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> So, apart from the theme and a few tens of patches to other modules (only included if they were accepted..) that's what we did.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1619_1628_10</DOCNO>

            	<DOCNO>s_1619_1628_11</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> Of course we use views heavily and there is a bit of using modules as glue, but you could replicate the whole site tomorrow with a list of modules and the theme.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1619_1628_12</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

The end result was quite a lot of work, finding a way of running concurrent development and future 'live' systems, trying to get a group of volunteer developers to complete specific tasks on a platform that doesn't lend itself that well to version control and generally working to find combinations of modules and work around to do what we needed.</TEXT>

Given [pirateparty.org.uk](http://www.pirateparty.org.uk) is a fairly high traffic site, we also had to look at performance, with our IT lead putting in a lot of time working out how best to deploy drupal on Debian, with nginx in a redundant manner..  But hey, there is lots of documentation and a good community so its more than doable.</TEXT>

Now, the end result isn't earth shattering (and we are now working on phase 2 requirements) but it looks like its going to work very well for us and change the way we have been working for a long time.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1619_1628_16</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> It means we can get volunteers in more easily to help us manage and maintain the site and, its going to reduce the amount of time we expend on web related stuff by an order of magnitude.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> On our old Django site, a press release took easily 20 minutes to format and publish, blogs and articles took a lot of time to complete, contacting members, donors and others was not-trivial and making even minor adjustments was a pain.</TEXT>

All in all thanks to Drupal (and Debian, Nginx etc..) we are going to be able to do more of the stuff that we are here to do - campaign and make a difference politically in the UK.</TEXT>

However, it's getting a little long in the tooth and I've been looking to see what might work as a sensible upgrade path - however, it seems that there isn't a huge amount of performance to be gained from newer models, there doesn't appear to be anything with a 4:3 screen nor anything without a touchpad on the palm rest...  Not to mention that the X230 I managed to borrow feels a lot more fragile (and less compact somehow..).</TEXT>

I wonder what the impact it would have on moderator behaviour having scores (on a per subreddit basis I think) for mod links and comments would have - or to take it a little further, to have stats on the number of posts or comments removed, users banned, replies to users etc...

Any thoughts?</TEXT>

As of today, all the issues ironed out, I can only say I'm incredibly proud of my eldest two - I work from home too and about 20 minutes in I realised I was sat at a table with my eldest two, everyone working quietly, only pausing to query spellings between each other.. http://i.imgur.com/R3uQF7p.jpg  (I had to take a picture).</TEXT>

They get to choose the music for the period too, so yesterday was the Beatles, today is bond themes (by brass bands) and the Eagles..

The posts themselves are incredibly obvious spam ('Awwww a dead hamster' as a subject that links to a US coupon site kind of thing) and most are picked up and dumped immediately into the spam queue, and some of the 'users' are being banned, but in a sub with just under 1,000 subscribers it seems odd to be seeing it at all.</TEXT>
