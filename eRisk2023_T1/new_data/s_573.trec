It's 1500 now and liberty desire is under check for now (I rejected the Scandinavian Constitution like you said), I'm finally back down to acceptable levels of AE after 2 massive coalition wars took next to nothing meaningful, and Muscovy lost Moskva to the Golden Horde so now I'm just patiently eating them up and recovering cores for my vassalized Novgobear.</TEXT>

Pretty much I integrate Holstein and Norway as soon as possible, and I can usually take quite a few Baltic Sea border territories by 1500 (Some of Novgorod, a lot of either the Lvonian or Teutonic Order, and sometimes a bit of Pomerania), but as I said before, usually Sweden or Muscovy or PLC decide it's time to reverse my advances.</TEXT>
