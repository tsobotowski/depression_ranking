            	<TEXT>It's for a Spotify playlist lol I'm basically looking for songs that give you the feel that you're in a snowy wonderland (would prefer if it's not a ballad, I want songs with a bit of idk 'oomph' to them) Obvious songs would be: 'In The Frozen' - Dreamcatcher 'HWAA' - (G)I-DLE Others I've added cause they just give me fantasy vibes: 'What' - Dreamcatcher 'Lucid Dream' - Aespa 'Break The Wall' - Dreamcatcher 'Over The Sky' - Dreamcatcher 'Chains' - Far Out, Alina Renae (EDM) 'Untouchable' - Everglow</TEXT>
