            	<TEXT>The thing is, those traditions and spiritualism have no label, both because they don't need to have one and because they weren't given one by whom they were developed, and Usually the word "paganism" is used generically to describe not only beliefs that are not the most popular ones but those beliefs native to a region/land, i.e the meaning is afopted and changed.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>The only reason tanktop master lost against garou is because he had very simple, powerful attacks like the tackle (that hurt G a great deal) which can be compared to Sukune's charge which Yujiro just took without even bothering to dodge before knocking him out cold with an annoyed punch, not even close to being full force.</TEXT>
