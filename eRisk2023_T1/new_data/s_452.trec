4 months of voice lessons, 3 years of choir

In previous posts I was told this could be a good audition song for a classical choir (I have only ever sung second soprano so I think that's what they would make me try out for) but I dunno, maybe another song would be better?</TEXT>

I have trouble at the end of each of the 3 sections because I kind of belt the beginning, which makes it harder to then shift up past the break so maybe I need a different song (or a hell of a lot more training).</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> Thank you for your input,

There are two voice teachers in my area, one isn't very musical (she uses just karaoke CDs and we warm up a cappella) but she is good at explaining things, and the other is very musical (can play any sheet music on the piano) but terrible at explaining things other than saying "like this".</TEXT>
