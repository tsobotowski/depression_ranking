The theory (as I understand it) behind the protocol is that since Rabies super-excites certain receptors in neurons in the brain (NMDA receptors) to cause peripheral nervous system hyperactivity and death, if you were to induce a coma by blocking NMDA receptors with something like ketamine, you could prevent the autonomic dysfunction that usually leads to death and buy the patient enough time to mount an immune response against the disease.</TEXT>

The stratum corner is a pretty tight barrier against a lot of stuff, but it is still made up of cells with hydrophobic membranes...so many hydrophobic compounds and lipophilic small molecules are more than happy to alter the cell membrane stiffness and pliability and/or pass right through.</TEXT>
