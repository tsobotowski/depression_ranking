"Young wom[e]n want to have sex, particularly if theyre drunk"

"why didn't [she] just sink [her] bottom down into the basin so he couldnt penetrate [her]"

"why couldn't [she] just keep [her] knees together"

"if she skews her pelvis slightly she can avoid him"

"Some sex and pain sometimes go together [] that's not necessarily a bad thing"

"sex is very often a challenge"

The judge didn't make one offhand comment that he got railroaded for, he continually argued that the woman is at fault for being drunk, for not fighting the man off, for complaining about a struggle and pain because challenge and pain are part of sex.</TEXT>
