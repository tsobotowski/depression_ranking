The biggest area's of contention for me is I'm not sure if elasticsearch's added benefits are necessary compared to a NoSQL solution for storing the JSON data, and I'm not sure if the ACID guarantees provided by a relational table are necessary, or if the eventual consistency for a NoSQL store or elasticsearch will be fast enough for a general purpose index, given that it seems each change id adds about 1000 items (I read that on this forum somewhere but don't have a link to the post).</TEXT>

I've been selling all of my SMG and most of my AR drops since none of the listed DPS comes close to the 135k dps of my G36 or the 160k of my hungry hog (because most SMG drops I've been getting are around 100k dps and other AR's in the 110-120k range), but I read on here recently that the sheet dps is meaningless.</TEXT>

For my situation, In case it matters for which stats to track/site to use, I'm currently ranked in the low 40s (Won 5 placements on KOTH, lost 4 on payload and one KOTH), I estimate my skill w/o the KOTH bug would be 45-50ish, which is where I'll most likely stick around for awhile.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> The reason I'd be ok with the octave up is that the wet signal would only be used for the dirt channel, so the synthy part won't matter as much as its pretty much gonna disappear once the gain structure hits it.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> If we had two guitarists I'd take the P bass easily, but because my guitarist likes to play around higher up in the guitar range (not solos, just main playing wise), it leaves a lot more room on the bottom open for the bass to fill, so I think that having a J bass might allow me to do more stuff with creating a unique sounding bass sound to go with the one guitarist setup.</TEXT>

The question I'm working on in summation notation is sum(4i-1) as i ranges from 1 to n.  I've gone step by step and reduced it to the formula n(2n+1) by taking it from summation notation into the n formula form.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> However, bass is a 5 string with a 34" scale length, so its not too big of an issue unless you're trying to get an extremely low action, as the shorter scale length means less tension, which means the string will vibrate more in the middle so you need to a have a higher action to compensate.</TEXT>

Tl;dr: if you have the same period of time in which one person gained a lot of muscle over half the time and gained no muscle from the other half, how would the muscle gained compare to someone ego gained muscle at a slower rate for 3/4 to 4/5 of the time and cut for the rest?</TEXT>

1) Is it the basic alpha (I don't like using alpha but it applies well here) body language that I should be conveying?</TEXT>

2)
If I see someone I like, I make eye contact and smile then simply walk up to her lean in a bit and wait for her to lean the rest of the way I say simply "Hi I'm MrADHD" and give them a twirl then say "let's dace for a bit"

Do you literally take her hand and spin her around?</TEXT>

3) 
 I escalate to touching tits, ass etc then a little kiss on the neck, then a number, to making out, then try (not need, just suggest or lead) bring her (and if need be her group) to my friends and dance there.</TEXT>
