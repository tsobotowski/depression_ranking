I thoroughly recommend this book on bumblebees - "A Sting in the Tale" by Dave Goulson

http://books.google.co.uk/books/about/A_Sting_in_the_Tale.html?id=MeKKfNsaWEEC redir_esc=y

Also, if you're interested in honeybees, "Clan Apis" by Jay Hosler is a really good graphic novel by a bee scientist.</TEXT>

(Copied from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulation_hypothesis)

There is also the fact that there is a minimum size (the Planck Constant) for things in the universe (ie things are "quantised", from which we get "quantum mechanics") - this implies that that the universe could be mapped to quantised data.</TEXT>

Sunshine OST (Jon Murphy and Underworld)
Moon OST (Clint Mansell)
Monsters OST (Jon Hopkins) (for me, the nicest to listen to of all of these)
Book of Eli OST (Atticus Ross)

If you want something with a structure and beat to it without completely losing touch with the Brian Eno end of free form ambient, have a look at:

HECQ
Aes Dana
Minilogue
The Boats
The Field
Peace Orchestra

And if you like those, you might like Trentemoller, particularly "The Last Resort" (but it's too structured to meditate to).</TEXT>

Now if you're not turned on by discussions of why Scott treats his android characters in Alien, Blade Runner and Prometheus as if they were more emotionally complex than his human ones; or how in all three films he plays with gender roles, rape imagery and perversion of procreation/parenthood/development; or how characters  in all three films seek to manipulate and are manipulated by a faceless corporation, even those who think they are calling the shots ...

I would humbly suggest that you need to see a therapist (which you're doing) to help you work through the depressed thoughts, and you also need to see a medical doctor to make sure there isn't an easily-fixed hormonal or chemical side to it (the depression part, I mean, but a doctor may be able to help you with your penis issue too).</TEXT>

To answer your question, it's a self-referential system so being aware of being aware of being aware is the same as being aware of being aware...

Or to lift an analogy from Terry Pratchett, it's awareness all the way down. :-)</TEXT>
