 - Introduce subject of invasion, demonstrate the "quirk" meant to differentiate this movie from all the other home invasion movies
 - Hints of incoming invasion
 - Night falls
 - Invasion begins
 - Boyfriend/Girlfriend/Neighbor shows up
 - Boyfriend/Girlfriend/Neighbor gets killed
 - Running around the house being invaded
 - Police show up
 - Police get killed
 - Eventually it either ends in the death of the invader or the invaded

Don't get me wrong, if my house was actually being invaded it would be fucking horrible.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> I'll just explain it for you again:

 - Any pause in the show is packed with jokes, to the point where if you're laughing at one you miss others
 - They aren't timed properly (see: comedic timing) as a result of the editing and the need to cram more jokes in during each pause in dialogue 
 - The jokes are crammed in to spaces where, at times, they refer to things that haven't been shown on-screen yet
 - The show has lost its improvisational feel as a result of this, which, in my opinion, is to its detriment.</TEXT>

 A) dog  dog  barking

 B) leg leg dancing

 C) tooth tooth biting

 D) nun priest sleeping

 E) ghost ghost always

There are several other sections like this, such as one where there are a few options on the order of sentences, where, again, the order changes the meaning of the paragraph, and there are a few short stories at the end.</TEXT>

The fact is this guy makes his living off of controversy so it could be that he is still processing trauma, or it could be that he knew these arguments were used by abusers and therefore it would be controversial for someone who experienced abuse to publicly espouse them - or, most likely, it's a mixture of the two.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1134_1014_23</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>I can see why this book has a reputation, but in all honesty, it was a much more enjoyable book than I would ever have expected simply by virtue of the fact that it is often absolutely hilarious and frequently prescient and insightful.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1134_1014_24</DOCNO>

**The Beach** by Alex Garland **** - An incredible character portrait - a book where I wasnt fully sure what was going on until 250 pages in, when things started to click and I realized this character I was reading about - all the weird things he had done that I had excused because I was seeing them from his point of view - was something different than what I had been thinking of him as.</TEXT>

Edit: Just in case anyone is curious, I do have a standardized way of rating books - it's entirely based on my own opinion/evaluation of course, but it helps ensure that my ratings are based on the same criteria and not just an impulse:

Is it a book?</TEXT>
