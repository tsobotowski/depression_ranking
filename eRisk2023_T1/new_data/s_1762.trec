999.99five nines fine: the purest type of gold currently produced; the Royal Canadian Mint regularly produces commemorative coins in this fineness

999.9four nines fine: e.g., ordinary Canadian Gold Maple Leaf and American Buffalo coins

99924 karat, also occasionally known as three nines fine: e.g., Chinese Gold Panda coins

995: the minimum allowed in Good Delivery gold bars

990two nines fine

986Ducat fineness: formerly used by Venetian and Holy Roman Empire mints; still in use in Austria and Hungary

958.323 karat

91622 karat: historically the most widely used fineness for gold bullion coins; currently used for British Sovereigns, South African Krugerrands and American Gold Eagles

900one nine fine: mostly used in Latin Monetary Union mintage (e.g. French and Swiss "Napoleon coin" 20 francs)

83420 karat

75018 karat

62515 karat

58514 karat

41710 karat

3769 karat

3338 karat

With the number to the left being the percentage of pure gold out of 1000, so 750 (18 Karat) = 75% pure gold by weight.</TEXT>
