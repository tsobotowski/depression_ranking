http://www.cbsnews.com/news/so-is-this-us-attorney-purge-unprecedented-or-not/ 

Last night, Fox News' Brit Hume kicked off his show by criticizing the media for "news stories reporting that the Bush administration had considered firing all 93 U.S. attorneys across the country [that] failed to mention that that is exactly what Bill Clinton did soon after taking office back in 1993."</TEXT>

Serve as head of the sixteen-member United States Intelligence Community,
Direct and oversee the National Intelligence Program; and
Serve as an advisor, upon invitation, to the President and his executive offices of the National Security Council, and the Homeland Security Council about intelligence matters related to national security;
On July 30, 2008, President George W. Bush issued Executive Order 13470,[1] amending Executive Order 12333 to strengthen the DNI's role.[2] Further, by Presidential Policy Directive 19 signed by Barack Obama in October 2012, the DNI was given overall responsibility for Intelligence Community whistleblowing and source protection.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Sociologists have attributed this trend to a number of reasons, starting from a simple boredom during services and lack of motivation, to generational incompatibility of belief systems and social changes attributed to modernity.[62] Research across 65 different nations showed that out of 20 advanced industrial countries - 16 demonstrated a declining rate of monthly church attendance.[63]

Here from wikipedia
A straw man is a common form of argument and is an informal fallacy based on giving the impression of refuting an opponent's argument, while refuting an argument that was not advanced by that opponent.[1] One who engages in this fallacy is said to be "attacking a straw man".</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> Well I did not make a fake news argument but I will show an example, below of an article representing opinion as fact and applying motive to people(suspected motive, again portrayed as fact).</TEXT>

This came right from the front page of this very sub:

https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2017/02/21/trump-is-set-to-introduce-a-new-muslim-ban-this-one-is-nonsense-too/?utm_term=.4c5224f704a8

First thing is the title.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_755_758_2</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>There is no muslim ban, but low and behold the Washington Post will call it that.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_755_758_3</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Secondly, from the article:
2) Senior White House adviser Stephen Miller has flatly stated that the White Houses real goal here is to establish to the media and Trumps political opponents that his power to act (nominally) in the interests of our national security will not be questioned.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_755_758_4</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>In other words, the White House has left little doubt that it views the battle over the ban as crucial to a bigger goal: establishing that our institutions cannot constrain Trump.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_755_758_5</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

The author is attributing that goal by taken past comments from Miller and using them to apply motive to the discussed order.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_755_758_6</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Miller did not state that this is the goal of the order.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_755_758_7</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

So in this example the author establishes a premise with the title and opening section that is based off of mislabeling the order and then attributing motive by reading into comments made previously.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_755_758_8</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>So it may not be 'fake' but it is more opinion than news.</TEXT>

 (initial capital letter) a political movement that employs the principles and methods of fascism...

the 14 characteristics on this website (http://www.rense.com/general37/fascism.htm) have some direct links to how the protesters act(they are not a state so not every category pertains to them);


1) Powerful and Continuing Nationalism - Fascist regimes tend to make constant use of patriotic mottos, slogans, symbols, songs, and other paraphernalia.</TEXT>
