The departments criteria indicate that, in order to qualify as an unpaid internship, the work must, among other things, be similar to training offered in a school setting, be performed for the benefit of the intern rather than the employer and not nudge aside that of existing employees.</TEXT>

From Buckley:

The legal reasoning is that a known liar cannot damage the reputation of anybody, because nobody will believe the slanderous remarks of a known public liar!That means that Limbaugh, Hannity and O' Reilly have made so many inaccurate, misleading and untruthful remarks about various people that they cannot be sued for libel because any reasonable person would never believe anything they said.</TEXT>

With todays more official reveal of the Titan X and its massive 12GB framebuffer, Nvidia has now introduced four unanswered graphics cards into the market since AMDs Radeon 285 in August 2014, and these GPUs have targeted a broad consumer demographic, ranging from the $200 GTX 960 all the way up to the $999 Titan X.

Thats 8 months without a new desktop GPU product from AMD, nearly an eternity in the tech world.</TEXT>

Add in the time you need to dork around in an airport (getting there 90 minutes before your flight to clear security and what not) and you can start to see there is a sizeable window where high speed trains would make sense and be competitively fast getting from Point-A to Point-B.

The Southern Poverty Law Center's Hatewatch blog has described it as a far-right organization.[6]

Chip Berlet, writing for the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) accused Horowitz of blaming slavery on "'black Africans ... abetted by dark-skinned Arabs'" and of "attack[ing] minority 'demands for special treatment' as 'only necessary because some blacks can't seem to locate the ladder of opportunity within reach of others,' rejecting the idea that they could be the victims of lingering racism.</TEXT>

The expansion you are talking about would only delay or stop a gamma ray burst from reaching us that was formed further than our horizon (about [46.5 billion light years](http://scienceblogs.com/startswithabang/2013/03/01/how-big-is-our-observable-universe/)...yes that is older than the universe but since it is expanding our horizon is bigger/older than that...read the article).</TEXT>

Here is a quote from an excellent writer about one of the best writers ever that illustrates the point:

Oscar Wilde, and there have been few greater and more complete lords of language in the past thousand years, once included with a manuscript he was delivering to his publisher, a compliments slip in which hed scribbled the injunction, Ill leave you to tidy up the woulds and shoulds, wills and shalls, thats and whichs etc.</TEXT>

Judith Stacey, of New York University, stated: "Rarely is there as much consensus in any area of social science as in the case of gay parenting, which is why the American Academy of Pediatrics and all of the major professional organizations with expertise in child welfare have issued reports and resolutions in support of gay and lesbian parental rights".[27] These organizations include the American Academy of Pediatrics,[6] the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry,[1] the American Psychiatric Association,[28] the American Psychological Association,[29] the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy,[30] the American Psychoanalytic Association,[31] the National Association of Social Workers,[32] the Child Welfare League of America,[33] the North American Council on Adoptable Children,[34] and Canadian Psychological Association.[35] In 2006, Gregory M. Herek stated in American Psychologist: "If gay, lesbian, or bisexual parents were inherently less capable than otherwise comparable heterosexual parents, their children would evidence problems regardless of the type of sample.</TEXT>

You are intentionally conflating what the studies are actually studying:

Brown, in which Judge Vaughn Walker found that the available studies on stepchildren, which opponents of same-sex marriage cited to support their position that it is best for a child to be raised by its biological mother and father, do not isolate "the genetic relationship between a parent and a child as a variable to be tested" and only compare "children raised by married, biological parents with children raised by single parents, unmarried mothers, step families and cohabiting parents," and thus "compare various family structures and do not emphasize biology.</TEXT>

EDIT to add:  Since this is getting downvoted (highlighting mine):

Some antifeminists have argued that feminism has resulted in changes to society's previous norms relating to sexuality, which they see as detrimental to traditional values or **conservative religious beliefs**.[12][13][14] For example, the ubiquity of casual sex and the decline of marriage are mentioned as negative consequences of feminism.[15][16] Many of these traditionalists oppose women's entry into the workforce, political office, and the voting process, as well as the lessening of male authority in families.[17] Antifeminists argue that a change of women's roles is a destructive force that endangers the family, or is contrary to religious morals.</TEXT>

Mustard gas was indeed far more nasty than the other two but its downside was it persisted in the environment for a long time (relatively speaking...weeks in this case) making it dangerous for troops to occupy an area cleared with mustard gas and in the end taking territory is the point.</TEXT>

That said a lot of "repressed memories" are induced and implanted by therapists:

In the early 1990s, the focus of Loftus work shifted to investigating whether it was possible to implant false memories for entire events that had never taken place.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_2922_893_4</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>The impetus for this new line of research was a case for which Loftus had been asked to provide expert testimony in 1990.[9][10][12][14] The unique point in this case was that George Franklin stood accused of murder, but the only evidence against him was provided by his daughter, Eileen Franklin-Lipsker, who claimed that she had initially repressed the memory of him raping and murdering her childhood friend, Susan Nason, 20 years earlier, and had only recently recovered it while undergoing therapy.[9][10][14] Loftus gave evidence about the malleability of memory, but had to concede that she did not know of any research about the particular kind of memory Franklin-Lipsker was claiming to have; Franklin was convicted (though in 1996 he was released upon appeal).[9][10][14]

At that time, many others were also making accusations, both in and out of court, based on recovered memories of trauma.[14] Loftus began work to find out whether some of these recovered memories might in fact be false memories, created by the suggestive techniques used by some therapists at the time and encouraged in some self-help books.[9][10][14] Ethically, she could not try to convince research subjects that they had been sexually abused by a relative as a child, so Loftus had to come up with a paradigm that involved childhood trauma without causing harm to subjects.</TEXT>

From Bill Bryson's book, [A Short History of Nearly Everything](http://www.amazon.com/A-Short-History-Nearly-Everything/dp/076790818X) (for geographic reference he is talking about an impact that happened in [Manson, Iowa](http://thewatchers.adorraeli.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/IA_66936.gif) some 74 million years ago and left the biggest crater in the US (you couldn't tell if you went there...nothing to see crater-wise anymore without using special equipment to see underground):

An asteroid or comet traveling at cosmic velocities would enter the earth's atmosphere at such a speed that the air beneath it couldn't get out of the way and would be compressed, as in a bicycle pump.</TEXT>

For those outside the zone of immediate devastation, the first inkling of catastrophe would be a flash of blinding light - the brightest ever seen by human eyes - followed an instant to a minute or two later by an apocalyptic sight of unimaginable grandeur: a rolling wall of darkness reaching high into the heavens, filling an entire field of view and traveling at thousands of miles an hour.</TEXT>

x = 0.999...


10x = 9.999...

10x - x = 9x

So:


9x = 9


Solve for x:

We usually do not experience gravity with energy because we are rarely around that much energy in one place (your mass converted to energy would be on the order of around [10,000 megatons](http://boards.straightdope.com/sdmb/showthread.php?t=122487))

So, if all the matter sucked into a black hole is converted to energy you will still feel the gravitational pull same as if it stayed as matter.</TEXT>
