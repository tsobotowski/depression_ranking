            	<TEXT> So I was looking through [this post on the Steam TF2 discussion board](https://steamcommunity.com/app/440/discussions/0/364040797996275899) where someone lists what they believe to be the pros and cons of each game, and then in the cons of Overwatch, this is written: *meta team comps, I have noticed if a team has chosen all the highest tier heroes the team becomes impossible to break down, think 12 engineers on turbine levels of defence with no uber available, I have studied tier lists and discussions and conclude that indeed a comp of certain heroes can beat any other team and this is a major downfall as it stops people playing a hero that they enjoy over a hero that will win.*</TEXT>

* Venge - Fantastic at taking people out of position, great at reducing armor and the aura is great
* Treant - the tower healing usually lets us stall their pushes and gives us map control for a long time, also he's great at rushing a gem and countering people like Mirana and Riki (especially in 7.00)
* Ogre - tbh ... I'm not sure what he's "good for" other than the RNG on his ult being funny, though I do like to pick him when there is someone like a Sniper or Tiny on my team so the Bloodlust machine can be even more helpful

After those three, I'm a little unsure.</TEXT>

I would love to practice more Abaddon for the heal/purge/slow that he provides, but I'm hesitant about melee for solo supporting (I realize Ogre and Treant are melee, but they're also either a. tanky as fuck or b. hit like a truck)

That leaves the following heroes: Bane, Dazzle, Jakiro, Lina, Rubick, Shadow Shaman, Silencer, Skywrath Mage, Undying, Venomancer, Witch Doctor

"Group up" "Spread out" "Split up and farm" all three of these sound decent to me

"I'm retreating" this one is probably super essential for someone not using chat or voice, so I'm including it without hesitation

"Out of mana" "Skills on cooldown" these seem possibly good, except you can alt-click on your health/skills, so probably not worth including 

(Similarly, the "missing bottom/mid/top" callouts seem pointless when you can be more specific by alt-clicking the enemy hero icon at top of the screen)

"Requesting a gank" however, this one seems possibly useless because I can't really trust strangers and try to focus on my game

"Destroy the tower, then get back" This one seems good

"Pulling creeps" I play a lot of support, so this one technically seems good.. except more than a few carries will ping me ask what I'm doing, so maybe it's not worth telling them

"Current Game Time" also seems pointless because you can alt-click the clock at top of the screen
