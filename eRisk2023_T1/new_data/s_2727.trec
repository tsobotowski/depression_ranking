If anything one of the unlooked-for effects has been that I feel much calmer and accepting of other people, more empathetic and trusting... 

Basically what I'm trying to say is that I've clearly fucked up here and am obviously not doing self-improvement right.</TEXT>

Basically we are an adaptive species, and like how we are not born knowing a specific language or culture, but rather with the ability to learn these things based on our formative experiences, so too it is with sexual attraction.</TEXT>

I especially like it because it means that if I don't like a book, *it remains unread* and so there's still that chance that some time down the line I might think "hey maybe I'll give it a go again" and find that, coming at it at a different time or from a different perspective, I might still have a chance to 'click' with it in a way I wouldn't have on the first reading.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>I know that doesn't sound like a big deal, and probably is a bit more of a 'goal-driven' way of approaching meditation, where perhaps the emphasis should be on the process itself, but I've found it motivating and helpful for staying disciplined, I don't want to break my streak :p

I also believe it allows you to set alerts for reminding you to meditate each day.</TEXT>

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freudian_slip

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malapropism

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spoonerism (this could be what you mean, it's when you accidentally transpose the first letters of two words, often with amusing results)

Part of it is to do with how you use the pill as a product.</TEXT>

But a lot of the time it's for general ease of dosage, particularly if they are prescribed pills that you yourself are meant to take regularly to a prescribed schedule.</TEXT>

It's also why a lot of birth control comes with placebo pills for seven days, rather than simply a break of no pills.</TEXT>

I reckon, although as someone else said, there is no way of predicting what evolution will do, that we could reasonably expect to get a mongrely sort of 'street dog', as we see in dogs living on the fringes of human settlements today, the type of dogs we think early proto-dogs living alongside humans would have looked like throughout most of the species' history.</TEXT>

Basically I'll tell my boyfriend I'm off to brush my teeth for bed but I get distracted and then half an hour later he'll have to come get me from there, my face all beat up and swollen and he'll be all "not this again god damn" and I'll have made tiny invisible or imagined imperfections into ugly marks that are gross but every time it is WORTH IT.</TEXT>

Edit:

Ok so here's a few things I've found...

**Bracelets**
Friendship bracelets are very inexpensive (for materials you just need the string/floss) and quite sweet, plus there's a lot of scope to make a custom, personal pattern or two, plus there's instructions for making them everywhere online:

Hope those are a helpful place to start, OP, sorry I didn't find loads of stuff, but I hope you find something to suit your crafting skill level and the sorts of things your girlfriend likes.</TEXT>

Obviously I'm not going to force the issue, and if he truly doesn't want rats in his home then I won't force them upon him, but his reasons against seem so trivial and I would so love to keep rats...

            	<TEXT> Monocular cues (cues to depth relying on only one eye) such as the ones listed in the other comments (movement, object size, texture gradient, occlusion, relative movement of your single eye etc...), are one part of the story.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>However the reason the world doesn't suddenly appear flat when you close one eye is also partly because you have gone through your entire life (from a certain young age at any rate) seeing the world in 3-D. Eyesight depends on your eyes but vision happens in the brain, the world is actively constructed for you by the information coming in through your eyes and even if one eye is shut it 'knows' that the world is still one of depth.</TEXT>
