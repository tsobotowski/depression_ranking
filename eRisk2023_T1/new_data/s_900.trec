I'm not saying swapping a Golf R drivetrain WOULDN'T work, but:

* Golf R wheelbase is 103.5", Fiesta is 98"
* Golf is 168" long, Fiesta is 160"
* Golf is 70" wide, Fiesta is 67"

Again I'm far from an expert, and obviously the drivetrain doesn't take up the full length/width of the vehicle, but it sounds like you'd have to do a lot of adjustment to make it fit.</TEXT>

The interiors are certainly *styled* in an almost identical manner, but  the quality did go up between the 350Z and its later generations, as well as the changes brought on by the 370Z. The 350Z's cubby hole door was some shitty hard plastic thing.</TEXT>

I try usually mixing Vallejo's "Pale Flesh" and either a gray or a brown depending on what I'm painting, a light brown wash, and then try to highlight... But it always comes out 1 of 2 ways:

* Too thick
* Too thin and splotchy

In either case, the wash often doesn't look great either.</TEXT>

If by "other Diablo games", you mean other "Diablo-like games", I can't comment much here as I never played many "Diablo clones" other than Torchlight and PoE.

 Basically, the reason why they're about to release a new Ancient version of the legendaries we already have is because people are still interested in playing the game even to this day, which sort of proves that the game isn't in fact broken since nobody in their right mind would play a broken game for that long.</TEXT>

 By setting the threshold at 250,000 subscribers and exempting small ISPs owned by larger companies, the FCC is effectively "exempt[ing] billion-dollar public companies" from rules that can be complied with in mere hours each year, said Mignon Clyburn, the FCC's only Democrat.</TEXT>

Trump Wall costs according to...

[Trump](https://youtu.be/vU8dCYocuyI?t=108) himself: $4B

[Paul Ryan](http://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/trump-border-wall-to-cost-dollar216-billion-take-35-years-to-build-internal-report/ar-AAmNQtl): $15B (further down in that same article, it cites [Bernstein Research](https://www.bernsteinresearch.com) as estimating up to $25B)

[Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-border-wall-cost_us_589cf9d9e4b0ab2d2b13ae7b): $21.6B

            	<TEXT>I realize both Trump/Ryan as well as MSN/HuffPo are *probably* going to be biased, so I tried to provide a variety of sources... Anyways...

$4B / 63M people = $63.49/per

$12B / 63M = $190.48

$15B / 63M = $238.10

$21.6B / 63M = $342.85

$25B / 63M = $396.82



Maaaaybe at the $63.49 tier he could get 63M backers on kickstarter :P

Though I guess he could just offer multiple tiers for more wealthy donors.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>So for its current usage in things like motorsports or very high-end performance cars,  this isn't as big of deal because:

1) Motorsports have other existing safety regulations (roll cages, Hans device etc)

2) Performance vehicles which currently make extensive use *generally* don't rack up too many miles / aren't bought for their safety ratings

Given its "conditional strength" from weave, is CF actually safe to replace steal / aluminum with for autobody construction for every-day cars that will be the sole means of transportation for millions of drivers?</TEXT>

Now, from a sport point of view, that *sort of* makes sense to force their point to hit an invalid target, but from a sword fighting stand point that's obviously really stupid to actively put your body in harm's way (though I suppose the arm is better than the flank, if I had to pick where to be stabbed).</TEXT>

Haven't had an opportunity to investigate it myself, but looking around online I found this thread:

Overall it sounds like it's not necessarily an uncommon occurrence / might not actually be anything wrong... But it's been a while since that thread was updated--wanted some more recent opinions.</TEXT>

I was talking to my coworker today, he had this theory that Tyrion is actually a bastard Targaryen, and these were his supporting arguments:


His mother was in King's Landing in the year 272 and one of the Targaryen's ruling at the time made comments to her, asking if her body was ruined from giving birth to the twins

Tyrion was born in 273, a year later (so, depending on when she was in King's Landing it could have been only 9 months)

Tyrion was described as a hideous baby with "a monster, with a tail, monstrous huge head, thick black hair, a beard, an evil eye, lion's claws, with teeth so long he was not able to close his mouth, and both male and female genitals." (</TEXT>

Building on that, this story was brought up in both the book (I believe Cersei tells Tyrion), and in the show (Oberyn described his disappointment that Tyrion was simply crippled, not a monster, when he visited Tyrion in his prison cell before his Trial for allegedly killing Joffrey).</TEXT>

I have almost 4 years of real world business programming under my belt, as well as my BS in software engineering, so it's not like I'm just some dummy who picked it up on a whim and expected everything to be great-- I understand the depth of what I'm getting into here...

Ultimately I want to build a SRPG sort of like FF Tactics or something along those lines-- 3D grid based map, 2D sprites, turn based action... But beyond slapping a few planes around, again, I have absolutely no idea where to go from here and all of these tutorials don't really *teach* me anything I feel like.</TEXT>

Like from a software dev point of view, I can loosely break down the systems that need to be developed: a system for generating maps, moving things along fixed paths on a grid, loose combat systems, selecting units, issuing command to each unit etc etc... I just have absolutely no idea how to begin, even on the most basic level.</TEXT>

I've poked around with Unity a little bit some more since then, but the other night me and a close friend from college seriously discussed game development and it's something we both want to do, so we're going to sit down Sunday and come up with a few short term projects and goals, and discuss my idea for a "real" project that I'd eventually like to have actually published in 5-10 years.</TEXT>

I initially signed up for class for a few reasons:

* get back in shape to go snowboarding in the winter
* meet people
* just generally try new things

I do enjoy fencing, I had a lot of fun with the beginner class and there were 1 or 2 decent people my age, and honesty I think it did a lot to help "kick-start" my confidence / help with the depression.</TEXT>

* Awesome MPG 
* Neat fold-up rear seats, the car is crazy spacious for a compact
* Brand New was in my budget (I know you lose a lot of money and often times this doesn't make the most sense, but I wanted something with a perfectly clean history that I did not have to worry about)
* Thought I'd do the "responsible" thing and forego a toy because I have $63K in student debt and live downtown / on street parking, didn't want a car I really care about in case it gets damaged

So, those are my reasons.</TEXT>

Ideally, my set of criteria would look like this:

* At least 4 inches tall (6-8 is ideal)
* Plastic
* Less assembly required the better (I don't think I'm gonna get this though)
* Fantasy (huge bonus for treant or 'nature' things like that)

I've got my eye on the [Treeman](http://www.games-workshop.com/en-US/Treeman) and [Treeman Ancient](http://www.games-workshop.com/en-US/Treeman-Ancient) from GW but the art style isn't 100% what I want.</TEXT>

The reason I'm considering selling it though is because *ideally* I want to get a replacement DD and turn my Z into a track project... But with massive student loans and my living situation (apartment complex; might be moving to a city w/o off-street parking) it's really not feasible to own two cars.</TEXT>

For me, the big things are:

* No kid
* Doesn't smoke (I guess I'd be ok with pot in small amounts)
* In college or working something other than retail
* Nonreligious

As I grow older, it's hard to find someone who doesn't have a kid it seems like.</TEXT>

Lich2, Denny1, Mortenebra, Goreshade 2 I think (never run him, not sure)

**Heavy Jacks:**
Slayer, Seether, Deathjack, Nightmare


**Light Jacks:**
2+ of each: Deathrippers, Ripjaws, Defilers

**Infantry:**
Bane Thralls   UA, 2 units of McThralls, Bile Thralls

**Solos**
BLT, Warwitch Siren, 2 Pistol Wraiths, Skarlock Thrall


I kind of want to buy the Witch Coven, and a bunch of Pirates or Ogrun stuff but I have no idea how effective any of them are (I never see them at my shop).</TEXT>

Go on over to Invidia's website to check out their prices and they have 3 options;

* Rolled stainless steel tips
* Rolled titanium tips
* Single layer titanium


But they're all the same price.</TEXT>

Here's what I own;
Denny1
Goreshade1 and 2
Gaspy2

2x Ripjaw
2x Deathrippers
2x Defilers
1x Slayer, Seether and Nightmare

1x Full unit of Bane Thralls   UA
1x Min unit of McThralls

1x Pistol Wraith
1x Bloat Thrall
1x Gorman Di Woulfe
1x BLT
1x Skarlock Thrall

1x Wraith Engine

There's a second box of Banes and their UA on the shelf I could pick up at the store, so I could run a Goreshade2 T2 list for one list, then just some pDenny for the other.</TEXT>
