I would recommend to stay away from the Western food though, theres nothing better than Xiao Chi in China (trust me, I used to go eat Western food a lot in Bejing and you just feel like you've missed out on a chance to try great food, especially as the Western foods aren't as authentic as the original)

With regards to how people perceive you though, don't get offended if people point out you're foreign or look more foreign: I'm fully Chinese, born and originate from Beijing and I get asked by strangers if I'm mixed race due to my darker skin (compared to other, paler girls in Beijing) and lack of accent.</TEXT>

Last year, I decided to get my hair digitally permed in Beijing during my summer there and it was far cheaper than in London, so if you're looking for a perm or professional dyeing, I suggest you do it in China (I'm assuming your Mandarin is good enough to communicate well with your hairstylist) and like always, bring photos to show your them what you want.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> I also tend to have a lot of blocked pores on my forehead and this can sometimes lead to squeezing *sorry sorry, it's awful I know* so I'd love to use something to target the blocked pores and blackheads around my nose and also to lift some freckles along my cheekbone.</TEXT>

**AM**:   

I don't wash my face with a cleanser in the morning, just cold water, and since doing this, have seen a positive improvement in frequency of blemishes.</TEXT>

- Mario Badescu Special Cucumber lotion (rec by a online sales staff but have seen no difference)  
- Mario Badescu Glycolic toner -nice but doesn't do a terrible lot  
- Instanaturals Vitamin C serum  
- Kiehls Dark Spot corrector: have not seen any difference  
- Kiehls Oil-free daily moisturiser  
- Lancme SPF: would like to change to an Asian suncreen maybe the Biore aqua, this pills when I rub my face, especially when I';m exercising.</TEXT>

Nothing really changes except I use the Neutrogena Pink Grapefruit Cleanser and Coconut oil to oil pull and:  

- Rosehip oil to massage the acne scars  
- 3x week I use a facemask, varying from Origins's clay mask, Origin's hydrating mask, and the many sheet masks I bring back from China  


All in all, I'd really appreciate it if you guys could recommend some AHA and BHA toners to clean the pores and make my skin glow and some brightening products e.g. serums or essences to lift some of my freckles and acne scarring, and maybe a cheap essence to use with the DIY sheetmasks that brightens and/or hydrates.</TEXT>
