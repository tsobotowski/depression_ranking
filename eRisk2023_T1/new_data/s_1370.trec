What frustrates me is that any critique of *any* right-of-center or conservative position [i.e., Islamophobia] from a left-of-center position is deemed not credible or invalid - even though a very similar critique is held by other conservatives and others on the right.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Whether aware of Islamophobia's critics on the conservative right or not, Turless's initial comment seemed to imply that since the link was to a left-of-center perspective (even if it had nothing to do with attacking Trump) and that I myself am left-of-center on many issues, it does not matter that my intention behind posting this article (praise the appointment decision b/c of McMaster's ant-Islamophobia stance) is shared by many conservatives.</TEXT>

That left me to believe that the fact that the critique of Islamophobia came from a left-of-enter perspective invalidated the whole thing in Turless's perspective, which thus means that his main beef with the post is the identity of the poster (me) and the identity of the blogger ('people like me').</TEXT>

I think one good place to start in trying to form such a coalition is the [American Solidarity Party](http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/a-different-conservatism/), a party in the mold of Merkel's [Christian Democratic Union](http://www.patheos.com/blogs/anxiousbench/2016/08/could-the-u-s-finally-get-a-significant-christian-democratic-party/), that is traditional and conservative on social issues and pro-life issues, but embraces some left-of-center proposals on economic issues.</TEXT>

In my mind, the most ardent NeverTrump supporters will never have a respected place in Trump's Republican Party, and enough Democrats who supported Clinton would feel so betrayed and disgusted by protest voters in their own party, that those two factions will be disgusted enough by their former allies to be open to starting a newly empowered coalition in the political center.</TEXT>

In other words, if we stick to ***realistic*** probabilistic calculations, even if we both agree that Stein would be able to switch electoral positions with Trump [which she has not so far], you'd have to agree that Clinton would ***still be doing better than Stein is***.</TEXT>

And this brings us to exactly where we are in chronological order:

1) Clinton
2) Trump
3) Johnson
4) Stein

If you insist that Stein is more popular the Clinton, Stein would have to move from position 4, pass Johnson, pass Trump, and then at least move within striking distance of Clinton.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1370_1238_13</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

In other words, if you would agree that at least some of the difference between the electoral positions between Trump and Clinton have to do with policy preferences, it is likely that if you would agree that Trump is farther away from you on the political spectrum than Clinton is, it would be ***necessarily*** true that you would ***rather*** Clinton become President than Trump.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>

If you prefer ***Johnson*** to Clinton, that does not change the electoral positions, because Johnson would still be one electoral position ***above*** Stein, which is deceptive since we're not counting the large ***vote share*** Johnson is leading Stein with.</TEXT>
        </DOC>

            	<DOCNO>s_1370_1238_15</DOCNO>

So, to go back to an argument based on the candidates' ***actual positions*** and assuming you're not so brazen as to write off the feelings of an entire sub-constituency, Clinton would still be beating Trump, and that ***necessitates*** her winning greater voter share than Stein.</TEXT>

And in fact, if Stein ***were not*** in the race, Clinton would be winning by larger margins over Trump, because by probabilistic reasoning [assuming that Johnson would be the second choice for Stein supporters], Johnson would ***still*** not be beating Clinton even with Stein's cumulative share.</TEXT>

and this:

  So, my vote for Stein is a vote against Trump AND Hillary.</TEXT>

If you insist that you can somehow cobble these two outcomes together, you'd be saying that theoretically, you'd want ***no parties***, which is an impossibility in our current form of presidential democracy.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1370_1239_22</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Therefore, in this current system, you are constrained in supporting one of the major parties.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1370_1239_23</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Now, explaining this does not mean I think the presidential system is the best.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1370_1239_24</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>I personally would like a parliamentary democracy, which Bernie Sanders himself says is more hospitable territory for third or even fourth parties.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1370_1239_25</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>But like Bernie Sanders said in his endorsement speech for Clinton, we sadly do not live in a political system that can sustain more than two leading parties.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1370_1239_26</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

In conclusion, instead of a protest vote, my suggestion is that perhaps a more preferable outcome is that you ensure that the candidate closer to your ideological position become President, and once that is ensured, you become active with an electoral or even party reform organization like [FairVote](http://www.fairvote.org/) or [The Center For Election Science](https://electology.org/), and ensure that the next President is the more likely one to be receptive to your political activism so you can push the system closer to a system that won't be constrained by two parties.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1370_1240_0</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> Yeah, so from the looks of your post, I think I might be a bit more familiar with the mechanics of presidential democracy than you are, in addition to being more familiar with electoral campaign history than you are.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1370_1240_1</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

In this system, a vote from third parties, while not always been outright a spoiler, has shaved off votes from either two of the major candidates (the **two** candidates leading in the polls).</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1370_1240_2</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Essentially, by voting for Stein, you are accomplishing **nothing** but denying votes for either of the two candidates.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1370_1240_3</DOCNO>

            	<DOCNO>s_1370_1240_4</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

So, let me rephrase your response:

In a two-party system, a vote for Trump is a vote for Trump **and** against the other candidates.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1370_1240_5</DOCNO>

            	<DOCNO>s_1370_1240_6</DOCNO>

A vote for Stein is for Stein *and* against the other candidates.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1370_1240_7</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>
 
And assuming we can agree on **basic facts**, Hillary Clinton will either win or lose by slim margins.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1370_1240_8</DOCNO>

            	<DOCNO>s_1370_1240_9</DOCNO>

            	<DOCNO>s_1370_1240_10</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Which brings me to my previous point: ** in all of her electoral campaign history, *nothing* indicates that a vote for Stein would assure a victory.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1370_1240_11</DOCNO>

            	<DOCNO>s_1370_1240_12</DOCNO>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1370_1240_13</DOCNO>

 During October 2013, the month after lane closures at the George Washington Bridge choked Fort Lee, N.J. with five days of traffic, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie discussed the fallout from the closures, the governments star witness testified Tuesday.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1370_1247_1</DOCNO>

Walton doesn't go on to make these speculations, but I believe this effectively buffered the institutionalized ethnic statism of the Democratic Party - and I think this very same ethnic statism leads to the predominantly white supporters of Bernie Or Bust throwing temper tantrums that the economy is "rigged" against them, while an increasing amount of [polls] (https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/for-blacks-and-hispanics-the-economic-glass-is-still-half-full/) show a [more positive economic outlook among communities of color](http://www.pewhispanic.org/2016/06/08/latinos-increasingly-confident-in-personal-finances-see-better-economic-times-ahead/) as we come out of the last recession.</TEXT>

As I read the comments from what I assume are supporters of Senator Sanders' and/or the "Bernie Or Bust" movement, has support for Senator Sanders himself always been an animating factor in the movement, or just a resentment directed towards Hillary Clinton and "party elites"?</TEXT>

Conversely, back to your initial idea that the youth vote lost faith with the DNC due to unpalatable policy shifts and the absence of voter outreach, too many voters only vote due to perceived necessity in presidential elections to a significantly greater degree than in local and state elections.</TEXT>

In fact, one of the reasons the delegate and superdelegate system was created was to ensure that if depressed voter turnout is low enough to allow a totally unpopular or unelectable or destructive candidate to win due to miserable turnout numbers [i.e., Trump], the delegates would step in to offset the low voter turnout.</TEXT>

In the Bernie vs. Hillary example, if his supporters *don't* vote for a Democratic nominee who is decidedly **not** the most conservative Democrat ideologically, not only will the DNC look for someone more conservative than Hillary to support, but Sanders' own supporters will have misguidedly caused figures similar to Bernie irrelevant and marginal to the Party's electoral calculus.</TEXT>
