Do you think a law company will employ notaries directly [as the French government does](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notaire), or should they be hired directly by private citizens to review contracts [as Americans do.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notary)

Seeing as a company would have to review the contract before agreeing to it anyway, I see companies putting out standard contracts forms like Legalzoom but keeping notaries on hand for custom work.</TEXT>

##[Excerpt: *A GUIDE TO SHIP REGISTRATION* by the Government of New Zealand](http://www.maritimenz.govt.nz/Publications-and-forms/Commercial-operations/Ship-registration/A-guide-to-Ship-Registration.pdf)

 The registration of ships is a time-honoured practice.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_331_1238_14</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>It began principally as a means of controlling ships entitled to carry 
cargoes within the seaborne empires of Europe.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_331_1238_15</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>In more recent times, however, **it has proved a convenient means of 
establishing title to the property in a vessel** - in other words, who owns it.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_331_1238_16</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>At the same time, **registration has served to 
determine which country's law governs the operation of a ship and the behaviour of those onboard** - key concepts which 
today play an important part in the international law of the sea.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_331_1238_17</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>
 
 Basically, **registration confers nationality on a ship and brings it within the jurisdiction of the law of the flag state**.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_331_1238_18</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Thus, a New 
Zealand registered ship is bound by New Zealand law - both its shipping and other applicable provisions - though the vessel 
may venture well outside the territorial limits of New Zealand. **</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_331_1238_19</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>A New Zealand ship abroad is accorded the protection of the 
Government of New Zealand**, much as a New Zealand citizen is while travelling overseas. **</TEXT>

by its registration papers** just as a passport establishes them for a person. **</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_331_1238_21</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Registration may also determine criminal jurisdiction 
in the event of any incident or accident in international waters.**</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_331_1238_22</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>
 
 Further, registration facilitates financial dealings in ships - their sale and purchase and the raising of mortgages - and **brings 
back to the owner responsibility for any liabilities incurred**.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_331_1238_23</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>It does so by evidencing title to a ship and thus declaring to all the 
world who owns a particular vessel.</TEXT>

Flying a flag of Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Cambodia, the Cayman Islands, North Korea, Georgia, Honduras, Lebanon, Malta, Mongolia, Panama, and Saint Vincent or the Grenadines is not going to afford the ship much protection in fact, flying these [makes you a target for inspection.](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_convenience#Port_state_targeting)

The installation called the Marysville Pilot Power Plant in [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwqwLoc93ZI) and [this video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dPIWSVhVHL0) is *not* the Kouris patented design.</TEXT>

##Watts

 GWVPPs are hydro power plants for low head from 0,7 up to 2m and for a flow rate from 0,05 up to 20m/s and for a power range from 0,5 up to 160kW.

##Pros and Cons

|Kourispower|Zotloeterer|
|:-----------|:----------|
|Creates open vortex on surface of standing water|Vortex is contained in concrete basin|
|Requires fish ladders/ minces fish that go through turbine|Fish are proven to be safe to traverse basin and weirs|
|Requires dam to create still water for stable vortex in addition to head|Requires only head, usually from weirs|
|Problematic to screen from debris without interrupting vortex|Vortex can take small debris, large debris screen is before inlet|
|Susceptible to debris clogging|Flush gate can be operated to clear screen for large debris|
|Maintenance requires draining dam to below outlet|Inlet can be closed for work, moving parts above water|

##Patents

Both groups list where they are patented [K](http://www.kourispower.com/about/) / [Z](http://www.zotloeterer.com/welcome/gravitation-water-vortex-power-plants/patents/), but Zotloeterer goes a step above and has most of what you need to recreate their design posted, published, or in the patents.</TEXT>

The proposal for the Maglev route was first put forward by Shinzo Abe, the Japanese prime minister, during talks with President Barack Obama in February and interest is increasing among states in the north-east of the US, according to Central Japan Railway Co. (edited to add quote)

IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES

Mr. JONES submitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary

CONCURRENT RESOLUTION

Expressing the sense of Congress that the use of offensive military force by a President without prior and clear authorization of an Act of Congress constitutes an impeachable high crime and misdemeanor under article II, section 4 of the Constitution.</TEXT>

Whereas the cornerstone of the Republic is honoring Congresss exclusive power to declare war under article I, section 8, clause 11 of the Constitution: Now, therefore, be it

Resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that, except in response to an actual or imminent attack against the territory of the United States, the use of offensive military force by a President without prior and clear authorization of an Act of Congress violates Congresss exclusive power to declare war under article I, section 8, clause 11 of the Constitution and therefore constitutes an impeachable high crime and misdemeanor under article II, section 4 of the Constitution.</TEXT>
