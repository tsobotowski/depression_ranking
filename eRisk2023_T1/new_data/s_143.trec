        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_143_13_4</DOCNO>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_143_13_9</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

TLDR; Your objects are out of scope because your arrays is an array of objects, not pointers, so game::npcs[game::total] = enemy(x, y, 1); will result in their deletion immediately.</TEXT>
        </DOC>

        <DOC>

So, the problem in your code is that you *technically* are deleting your enemy's texture.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_143_15_2</DOCNO>

When you create your enemy it its constructor (enemy::enemy(int x, int y, int type)), you create a local texture variable (sf::Texture texture;).</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_143_15_3</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> Notice that this is not a pointer to a texture, but is a new texture object in that constructor.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_143_15_4</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> When your constructor exists however, it gets rid of all local variables created within there.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_143_15_5</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> In this case, because you created a new object, and not a pointer to an object, it will delete your texture when exiting the enemy constructor, thus creating the white square problem.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_143_15_6</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> Remember, any time a method finishes, it cleans up everything.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_143_15_7</DOCNO>

*Technically* pointers also get destroyed, but what they reference does not!</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_143_15_8</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> Hence, a quick solution to fix this is to change your texture to a pointer (sf::Texture* texture;) and create it using the new keyword.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_143_15_9</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> Make sure however that you keep that reference so you can delete it later, otherwise you will end up never deleting the texture object that is referenced, and will end up with a nice memory leak.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> Obviously because I'm doing the stream to make games, I've made a ton of games during this time, but there's also been a huge awareness to the quality of what I make as well that's occurred.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_143_31_2</DOCNO>

            	<DOCNO>s_143_31_3</DOCNO>

The other big thing that's been helpful is that it's forced me to learn proper terminology, something I've pushed off a ton during my school years.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_143_31_4</DOCNO>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_143_31_6</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Finally, I've learned about a lot of new tools for my videos, as I didn't want to spend a whole lot of time with setup and such.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_143_31_7</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> Thus I've learned a lot more about other engines, in order to simplify my development.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_143_31_8</DOCNO>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_143_31_9</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> So when I went to work one week and needed to use it, I was able to use it there, without needing to do a whole lot of extra research on what I wanted to do.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_143_31_10</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

And obviously of course I've learned some new things about C++ and SFML along the way :)

TL;DR: My code quality awareness has gone up, my use of proper terminology has gotten better, and I've learned a ton of new APIs thanks to this stream.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> Okay, so this is based on the original idea I had when I made this (sorry, been running around all day so only just got to typing this haha):

-Lyrics go with Garnet dancing around
-Some kind of faster paced animation while singing goes
-Once "Go ahead and hit me if you're able" is sung, they split again and dance around, maybe introduce Jasper into the video and have the three of them fighting.</TEXT>
