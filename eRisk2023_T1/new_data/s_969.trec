**Explanation of how installing the mods work** (modders, skip this part):

 

Every non-graphical mod you're installing has a similar set of instructions.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_969_85_9</DOCNO>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_969_85_10</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>then you open the "bundle" folder.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_969_85_11</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>This is where the bundle files are kept that contain a lot of the games information that you can edit -- again see polymorpher's explanation for more detail.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_969_85_12</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

 

The instructions ask you to paste all their files directly into the bundle folder.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_969_85_13</DOCNO>

            	<TEXT>There will be a few things that you are always putting  in there:

*     Quickbms.exe
*     A folder
*     A .bms file
*     A .bat file

If you read polymorpher's guide, you should know what most of these do.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_969_85_16</DOCNO>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_969_85_17</DOCNO>

However, the .bat file is a little different.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_969_85_23</DOCNO>

The standard code for quickbms:

A sample code used for Witcher 3 mods:

quickbms -G -w -r witcher3.bms patch.bundle MyMod

The code does exactly the same thing you did to reimport your code by clicking on a few different screens.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>More information on how to use quickbms is available here: http://aluigi.alterv...rs/quickbms.txt

 

The better modders also give you a way to uninstall the mod.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_969_85_26</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>So you also are given another .bat file, named uninstall_mymod and another folder which contains the original code for the game that will be reimported.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_969_85_28</DOCNO>

The prophecies:

Correct: 3 (but see disputations about genealogy) 

Any Jew, only prophetic in a general sense: 2

About the Messiah but Misinterpreted: 4

Not a prophecy: 5

Not about the Messiah: 1, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, 21, 26, 27, 28, 29

Psalms: 6, 9, 13, 18, 19, 20, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26 

Psalms is not prophetic, it is very nice poetry.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Sequence of events:

* Hamas kidnaps and kills teenagers
*  Israel cracks down on Hamas members in the West Bank and starts sweeping manhunt
* Hamas uses this as an excuse to start bombarding southern Israeli residents with rockets
* Israel responds with limited airstrikes and proposes a few quiet-for-quiet agreements
* Hamas rejects these, as well as proposed ceasefires, while saying that it is responding to Israeli aggression; Israel begins official military operation
* Palestinians, militants and civilians, die, as well as a few Israeli civilians
* Ground invasion commences, after Hamas attacks from tunnels, with the purpose eliminate those tunnels; 
* Hamas gets the opportunity to kill and kidnap soldiers, and put many more Palestinian civilians at risk during the fighting
* Israeli ground invasion concludes and ground troops withdraw after tunnels destroyed, as Israel declines to commence a full invasion to eliminate Hamas
* Hamas continues firing rockets, and Israel continues attacking by air
* Hamas accepts a ceasefire once they are close to running out of rockets

The potential and real accomplishments of starting a fight with Israel:

* Increased popularity, both at home and abroad, especially vis a vis Fatah
* Increase donations by terror funders (i.e. Qatar) and well meaning countries and individuals
* Dead Israeli civilians and soldiers
* Captured Israeli civilians and soldiers
* Potential for a massacre of Israelis through fighters emerging from tunnels
* Dead Palestinian civilians to show to the world
* Dead Palestinian militants to show as civilians to the world
* Pressure on Israel to ease blockade 
* Increase support for the right wing in Israel

[Here is Ha'aretz on the 2012 analysis.](http://www.haaretz.com/opinion/how-many-rockets-has-iron-dome-really-intercepted.premium-1.508277
) Two articles([1](http://www.technologyreview.com/news/528916/israeli-rocket-defense-system-is-failing-at-crucial-task-expert-analysts-say/

[Here are the latest IDF statistics](http://www.idfblog.com/blog/2014/08/05/operation-protective-edge-numbers/
) of rockets fired at Israel (note: as of 8/05):

* 3,360 rockets fired 
* 2,303 hit Israel (70%)
* 475 hit gaza (14%) 
* 584 intercepted by Iron dome (17%)

If the IDF claims an 80% success rate of Iron Dome, that means:

* they fired at about 730 (22% of total rockets)
* and missed 150 (5% of total rockets) 
* Most of the 2000+ rockets that did hit would have hit open areas, but not all.</TEXT>
