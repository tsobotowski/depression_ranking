And for what it's worth a couple of things: not sure anyone's arguing with your opinion about the applicability of 40 time to chasing down plays; it's your opinion that he isn't athletic and is just big that's causing disagreement.</TEXT>

All of that said, I have been deeply alarmed by Trump's attacks via Twitter on pretty much anyone who disagrees with him, his constant misrepresentation of facts, no matter how trivial, his obvious reversals on many of his campaign promises, including, most specifically, his appointments of numerous people connected to Wall Street when he expressly negatively characterized Hilary as being beholden to Wall Street, his perpetual attacks on the integrity of the judiciary and the very security apparatus which informs his office, his propensity to try to learn about the world from TV and not from experts, his apparent desire to leverage his position for personal gain at the expense of the Constitution, his apparently illegal appointment of Bannon onto the Security Counsel....I could go on.</TEXT>

Additionally, however, to answer your question, I've read many of the same reports I'm guessing/hoping you have, regarding the reports that Russia was involved in the campaign, the Rosneft transaction, the reports of Trump's interactions with Putin, his denials of said interactions, his comments suggesting that the U.S. is as bad as Russia, his efforts to convince Abe to accommodate Putin, the reports from Kushner's own paper suggesting that the CIA no longer wants to advise Trump as to security matters due to their concern that he has been compromised, and the suggestions that the only reason a rational person would behave the way he has is if he is being blackmailed or is in cahoots.</TEXT>

Miracle Mile was in many ways a bookend to a period which began with [Testament](http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/testament-1983), a period of social upheaval in which Reagan surprisingly reneged on a Conservative ideal at the time that the more nukes we had the better; during that period the U.S. reduced its nuclear arsenal pursuant to [START II](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/START_II), and Jonathan Schell wrote his seminal work [The Fate of the Earth](http://www.sup.org/books/title/?id=418).</TEXT>

As for the development of the process, I found this explanation: *In a Greasham College lecture by Robin Wilson at Barnard's Inn Hall in London, he credited the invention of the modern long division process to Briggs, "The first Gresham Professor of Geometry, in early 1597, was Henry Briggs, who invented the method of long division that we all learnt at school"*  [here](http://pballew.blogspot.com/2013/10/division-some-notes-on-history-of.html).</TEXT>

I have tried:  
(1) using the chrome cleanup tool;  
(2) uninstalling chrome, deleting a google key via regedit, and reinstalling chrome;  
(3) creating a new profile;  
(4) installing a new theme and removing it (the reset to default button activated only long enough to allow me to remove the new theme--reverting the google.com page to the ugly old (*not* default) theme);  
and probably some other steps I can't recall.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> A few days ago, [as can be seen here](http://www.reddit.com/r/techsupport/comments/2dr4ej/help_adding_second_router), you guys helped me decide to set up a wireless access point; I was trying to figure out how to strengthen the signal of my home wi-fi network on the second floor of our house.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1469_1633_2</DOCNO>

Following your advice, I bought a Linksys WAP54G.  I configured it as an access point, and it definitely strengthened the signal.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1469_1633_7</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

I did not change any settings on the original router or on the Kindle, so it seems that there's some setting in the WAP54G I need to change so I can avoid having to take the extra step every time I want to use the Kindle at home.</TEXT>
        </DOC>

            	<DOCNO>s_1469_1633_8</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

I just don't know what setting it might be or if this "feature" is simply an unavoidable part of the WAP54G.

Could someone possibly tell me what setting this might be?</TEXT>

2) turning off my firewall;  
3) turning the program off and back on;  
4) starting Firefox in safe mode to see if an add-on was causing the problem;

**(a)** Kiffin/Marinelli can work their magic on a bunch of rejects;  
**(b)** the defensive guys on whom the Cowboys expected to rely can regain their health (i.e., next year);  
**(c)** the Cowboys find a good RB who can stay on the field (see comment about next year); and  
**(d)** they can build a decent offensive line.</TEXT>

**Conclusions (a kind of TLDR)**

The Cowboys didnt lose this game because they failed to run enough or because of playcalling.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1469_1775_141</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> They lost because:

1) they faced too many 2nd and longs, almost always because of mistakes by the OL (sacks, penalties);

2) they werent able to adjust to Rivers short drops, which eliminated any pressure and allowed the Chargers to take advantage of an inherent weakness in the Cover 2;

3) at key moments, drops by Bryant and Witten, and Williams fumble.</TEXT>
