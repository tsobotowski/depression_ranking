Quick Breakfast Ideas:
- Banana milkshake (banana + milk + sweetener like honey if you need it)

- Yoghurt with a bunch of fruits and nuts (e.g. avocado, pine nuts, chia, cherries, banana) and honey if you need a sweetener

- If you wanna bulk up during the weekends try making sausages, beans, eggs, toast, mushrooms and bacon by frying them separately.</TEXT>

Lunch/Dinner ideas
- Fried rice (use spam/bacon and eggs, and day-old rice) 

- Cream based pasta with mushroom and chicken (this is a house favourite - fry up bacon and mushrooms, then use the drippings to make a sauce by adding double cream) 

- Potato salad: boil potatoes and eggs, cut and mix with mayo, bits of ham, olive oil, cherry tomatoes, etc.</TEXT>

- Olive oil based pasta (I add lemon juice, pepper, garlic and shrimp that is precooked) 

- Carbonara 

I don't have a cast iron skillet so I just put my steaks into bake mode for 15 mins at 200 degrees, creates a great medium-rare steak.</TEXT>
