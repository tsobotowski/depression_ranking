Most would agree Schools, teacher salaries etc are typically funded by real estate taxes

Philadelphia is *legendarily* bad at collecting real estates taxes

Example: https://www.google.com/amp/www.phillymag.com/news/2015/04/15/paying-taxes-philadelphia-optional/%3Famp%3D1

Further, property values are either depressed or undervalued I.E. what taxes are received are far below what receipts should be

As a result, because nothing is paid in, nothing is paid out IE teachers get nothing because money still doesn't grow on trees.</TEXT>

We who love philosophy can circle jerk all day about the intangibles of existence, but until we provide *actual* value to a conversation people care about, and stop trying to turn every disagreement into an elenchus/teaching opportunity, the entire concept of philosophy will remain either too abstract, or worse a joke, to an every day person.</TEXT>

Help raise money for new(er) companies (investment banking)

Help existing companies increase value for all owners, including the regular person, in secondary market (the stock market as most people know it)

Help you manage your money (wealth management and financial advice)

Help entities/individuals/states/counties manage risk and exposure (derivatives and synthetic products)

Help entities/states/countries raise money they need in exchange for future payments to those that loaned them money (fixed income and debt issuances)

Help provide liquidity to banks that want to make loans to regular people (The Fed and institutional lending)

Insure the money of bank deposits and brokerage accounts (FDIC and SIPC)

Oversee financial firms to ensure they don't screw over customers and comply with law (SEC, FINRA, OCC, FSA etc)

Make it possible for financial transactions to be completed or "settle" (DTC, NSCC, Euroclear, CREST, etc)

Move money around the globe (Fed Wires, ACH etc.</TEXT>

If you have a Verizon wireless phone you get a 30% discount (I think, I know you get a discount)

Since you've done these types of studies you're better equipped to tell me:
1) how often are women raping men (not children, grown men)
2) in those cases how does sentencing compare to men (I'm sure there are many more cases of men vs. women (or men), but there should be some
3) when compared to other crimes, how does rape sentencing typically play out E.g. Is it analogous to manslaughter, car theft or something else.</TEXT>

Again, you've done the studies so you're better equipped to know, but rape should definitely have a more severe punishment than 8 years in jail IMO (I cheated and grabbed a quick link for that number.)</TEXT>

Carjacking carries ten to fifteen years in prison in some cases (again, quick link)

If someone can honestly tell me that possibly being dragged out of your car and having it stolen, is worse than rape, then I'd be very surprised.</TEXT>

That said, you've explicitly stated:
-You have a fair amount of debt
-Both you and your wife are not financially responsible
-By posting this comment you are admitting you have no idea what to do with the money (that's a good thing because you realize it)

Investment managers, specifically those that act as a fiduciary for a trust (because they are legally required to act in your wife's best interest) are more adept at managing this situation than you are.</TEXT>

In season mode, on the hardest difficulty, I:

Played a perfect, undefeated season 

Closed out the World Series with a perfect game and over 100 runs scored

The tricks to doing so:

**Batting:** 

The batting reticle ( a 3D square within a square) appeared to encourage batters to get a bullseye to get better hits.</TEXT>

Answer:

There was once a time when kids were actually left back a grade or expelled.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_320_724_2</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Suspensions were events that either preceded those events or, ultimately, led to them.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_320_724_3</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Nowadays that rarely happens and kids are essentially passed to a new grade/school to be "some other teacher's problem"

Hence, while today an out of school suspension amounts to giving a kid vacation days, the original intended purpose was a precursor to a much more severe punishment intended to ensure the child behaved.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> I was going to say a wiseass response to this, but then it dawned on me, I think there is actually a correct answer: condoms

While not technically food, heroin mules have been ingesting large quantities of drugs for years i.e. there is historical precedent for condoms being consumed even if they don't provide nutritional value (but then again, neither do pixie sticks).</TEXT>

2) Then they give tax cuts to those in the highest tax brackets

Thus, the companies have higher earnings and pay lower taxes.</TEXT>

This makes the executives (1%ers) look good, who get paid more for better than expected company performance

In turn those same executives are taxed at a lower personal rate on their performance based pay (or taxed at lower rates in end around ways that regular people don't understand like ordinary vs. interest income)

So the government both loses tax revenue to the corporations *and* the individuals running them.</TEXT>

Your second comment re: tax incentives and cheap labor, sounds like it is critical of the practice of globalization i.e. tax incentives to keep companies here are better than companies moving jobs overseas

Your third comment re: Companies playing states against each other, sounds like you are defending the practice of shipping jobs wherever a company gets the best deal.</TEXT>

-However, your second point appears to state a company does not have the right to operate by taking jobs overseas i.e. there is a limit to which we will allow them to effectively manage their payroll and expenses.</TEXT>

Whether a person, child or woman, is going to be abducted is in the mind of the person operating the vehicle

We tell children it's *not okay* to get in a stranger's car because we presume a stranger *will* do them harm (which is an unquestionably fair conclusion)

We tell women it *is okay* for them to get in a stranger's car because a stranger *most likely* won't do them harm (which is an arguably fair conclusion)

However, in both scenarios, neither the woman nor the child knows the thoughts of the driver i.e. the risk mechanics of the situation don't change.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> That said, to explain like poster is 5, I would have shortened it to:

Breasts, unlike hands, attract a mate

Hormones make breasts large (preferred when mating)

Hormones can lead to breasts of different sizes (not preferred when mating)

Hormones also weaken immune system (Not preferred when mating)

Thus, a woman with large breasts that are the same size has good genes (optimal for mating)

Gross oversimplification of a fantastic answer but it is an ELI5 :)

If you're using a half pint jar (8 oz), then I'd argue you're savoring the cherry notes of a classic vintage and I hope you've paired it with a perfect dish like lamb tajine and blue lobster with fine cumin (as recommended by Veuve Clicquot)

If you're using a jelly jar (12 oz) or larger, then you're everything that's wrong with America.</TEXT>

CJD is not generally contracted from animals (link 1)

The famous english/Irish Bovine spongiform encephalopathy outbreak was linked back to feeding cows the remains of other cows (cow cannibalism if you will) i.e. The issue of cannibalism being a source of prions disease is not resolved.</TEXT>

For anyone in the tl;dr camp, the potential psychological problems considered by the study were: 

depression, psychological distress/stress, substance use, body image problems, other psychological problems, and negative social functioning (e.g., loneliness)

Obviously all of these are a concern to a psychologist, but the layperson reading this headline will read:

"Men who see themselves as playboys or as having power over women are more likely to have psychological problems"

As 

"Men who think they are better than women are more likely to be sociopaths"

The study is **WAY** more nuanced that.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> In defense of Asian drivers: 

I've actually driven throughout most of Japan and I was shocked by:
1) How low speed limits were in some places
2) The strict adherence to those limits (I actually argued with my taxi driver on way to airport in Osaka...or at least tried to lmao)

It made me realize, the real problem on the road is the group of Americans that treat the speed limit like a suggestion (and I'm including myself in that group)

(Yes, I know the above comment is intended as a joke)</TEXT>
