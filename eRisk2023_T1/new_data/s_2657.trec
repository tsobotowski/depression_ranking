PSU: Silverstone Strider Plus 600W ST60F-P	
MOBO: ASRock Z68 Extreme3 Gen3 Motherboard	
OS: Windows 7 Home Premium

"Basically, it is like 'The Godfather'; its the Empire slowly building up its power base around the galaxy, what happens in Coruscant, which is the major capital, and its [about] a group of underground bosses who live there and control drugs, prostitution..."
Rick McCallum

Personally I think it would be an amazing on HBO if they put in a similar 10 episode season like they do with Game of Thrones with a similar budget as well, however the chances of that happening are nil since Disney own the ABC network which they would most likely produce it on.</TEXT>
