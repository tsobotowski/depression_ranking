            	<TEXT>[Guest monsters](http://classic.battle.net/diablo2exp/monsters/act5.shtml) are a thing on Nightmare and Hell difficulty in Act V. Those lightning-spewing scarabs you missed so badly from Act II; the bone fetishes which always ran to give you hugs in the Durance of Hate... well, there's a chance they may be back in Act V NM and Hell :P.
