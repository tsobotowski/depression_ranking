The term "suffragette" was first used as a term of derision by the journalist Charles E. Hands in the London Daily Mail for activists in the movement for women's suffrage, in particular members of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU).[7] But the objects of the intended ridicule gladly embraced the term saying "suffraGETtes" (hardening the g) implied not only that they wanted the vote, but that they intended to get it as well.[8]

Here's a Wiki article that talks about various methods: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/False_accusation_of_rape

The problem here is that you insist on calling someone who was either proven innocent, or where the case was dropped due to insufficient evidence, a rapist.</TEXT>

Well, as I said before, rape is a difficult crime to prosecute in many cases and it is very rare for a person is shown to be factually innocent, so it is safe to say that the vast majority of cases where a man or woman claims to have been raped, it is most likely to be factually true.</TEXT>

It would appear from Numbers 31:2627 and Deuteronomy 20:1011 that prisoners of war could be, and were, taken into bondage, but it has been contended that no prisoners of war were ever taken into private slavery (Kaufmann, Y., Toledot 1 (1937), 651).</TEXT>

Here's an interesting essay: http://www.academia.edu/3291535/_Rise_Up_and_Kill_Him_First_On_Modern_Attempts_to_Create_a_Jewish_Ethics_of_War_Nova_et_Vetera_10_2012_pp._1183-1213

In his autobiography, Tony Bennett claims to have created "...the first music video" when he was filmed walking along the Serpentine in Hyde Park, London in 1956, with the resulting clip being set to his recording of the song "Stranger in Paradise".[8] The clip was sent to UK and US television stations and aired on shows including Dick Clark's American Bandstand.[9]
