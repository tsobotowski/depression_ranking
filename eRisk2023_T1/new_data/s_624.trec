Kassadin ult range: 450 

Cool down:7/5/3

Mana cost 60 x2 up to a total of 980

Nidalee pounce range: 375 (750 against hunted)

Cool down: 5

Mana cost: 0

In short, the champion who's entire kit is based around his mobility is basically outclassed by Nidalee.</TEXT>

One of the main combos you can do on her is throw a Q, wait a few seconds, R to them, proc your Q with your auto, throw your Q that just came of cooldown, and proc with your E. This can take someone from 60-0 in the span of a second at level 6.</TEXT>
