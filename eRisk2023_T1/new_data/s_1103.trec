Just for clarification, some things covered in education include:

- Engineering Computation (Basically programming with Matlab)
- Engineering math, calculus I,II,III, linear algebra
- Engineering risk analysis
- Database Systems (Programming with SQL)
- Python, C++ and Java
- GIS, GIS and more GIS
- Some remote sensing 
- A handful of geology courses 

I apologise for any inconvenience I may cause but thank you in advance for offering your insight!</TEXT>

Pros:
