So for example, if you've got 1.5A capable motors, on a A4988 they would be set to a vref of 1.05 (A4988s can't generally handle this without overheating though) (0.7x vref on an A4988, 0.5x vref on a DRV8825)

Your acceleration at 3000mm/s^2 isn't bad, it's actually somewhat low - so you shouldn't be seeing too many artifacts.</TEXT>

So if I brought the lower price, quality filament for PLA that I use, or a similar spool of ABS, up to the 1000cc (assuming 1kg = 734cc of material) then the $43 spool would be 1000/743 = 1.36 (required multiplier to get up to 1000cc of material); $43 x 1.36 = $58.</TEXT>

 However, in February 2012 the Eleventh Circuit ruled otherwise - finding that requiring a defendant to produce an encrypted drive's password would violate the Constitution, becoming the first federal circuit court to rule on the issue.[69][70] In April 2013, a District Court magistrate judge in Wisconsin refused to compel a suspect to provide the encryption password to his hard drive after FBI agents had unsuccessfully **spent months trying to decrypt the data.**[71][72]

That's also why you use sentence-based passwords.</TEXT>

I'm using that circuit for some stepper drivers that I've made with attiny45s + ULN2003a -- they're incredibly cheap $3 to make per stepper driver, but I'd like to compress the circuit a little by hiding the 1k ohm resistors under the socket for the ULN2003.</TEXT>

Some people at my local hackerspace want to create a waterfall printer, but rapidly gave up after seeing that solenoid valves were $13/pop and we would require a *lot* of them in order to get anything decent.</TEXT>

We've had some crazy ideas thrown around, like modifying pens to be valves, etc...

Even if you think your idea is stupid, mind throwing some my way on how I might be able to replace a solenoid valve with some mechanical/electromechanical process?</TEXT>

As soon as I can I'll take some pictures, because the stove is in place, the outlets are wired up, the fluorescent light is installed again, and the countertop is installed (I managed to get the whole countertop for $50)...

I had never hung cabinets, laid tile, or most of the other stuff I did to get this kitchen back in shape. :)</TEXT>

Soldering (MintyBoost kit provided)    
Surface Mount Soldering (advanced soldering classes)    
Arduino (a platform that can be used to build almost anything)    
And many more will come, as we're setting up a system for anyone to host their own classes...

First off, the premium-feature for RealID inviting friends to a cross-realm group to queue for dungeons, should be changed to a non-premium, and friend based invite system which spans all realms.</TEXT>

**tl;dr**: Dungeon finder makes it less of a necessity to acquire and establish friendships within your realm and thusly  is making a bunch of people "bored" and quit the game because they don't have any more friends to play with.</TEXT>

        def onSend(self, destination, data):
            doSomeSending(data)

And then work from there, building out the client, or being able to freely add/remove a GUI layer later on (by binding key events to the onSend method, etc.) --</TEXT>

We could use some people testing/trying it out, as it's the ***ONLY*** fully cross platform VoIP software out there at the moment, meaning it has full server, and full client available for Windows, Linux, and Mac (Both PPC and X86 builds are available) and there are also some builds floating around there for ARM processors (for example, you could run a server on your DD-WRT router)

Also feel free to use the public server and the sandbox server to test things out or just use them as you see fit.</TEXT>
