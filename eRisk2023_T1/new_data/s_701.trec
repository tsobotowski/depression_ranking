Anyway, OP, I'm not all that knowledgable about etizolam but I heard that it's pretty good for anxiety, but I've also heard that it's kinda weird and can be heavily sedating and cause black outs with small doses to it's kinda hard to dose with it for anxiety... I think everyone's different with this particular drug (kinda like every other drug, I know, but this one seems to react differently with everyone).</TEXT>

Sedation - In terms of energy level alterations, Etizolam is extremely sedating and often results in an overwhelmingly lethargic state - Got this from [here.](http://psychonautwiki.org/wiki/Etizolam).</TEXT>

I also get extreme stomach pains from time to time (they don't happen that often) that will literally floor me and make me scream in pain, even if I'm out in public.</TEXT>

The weirdest thing about my drug history is that I started off abusing stimulants, especially high doses of snorted Ritalin (which will most likely fry your brain if you binge on that stuff for more than a week), and Amphetamine a few times, then basically I saw some codeine 30mg (per pill) and started off abusing Morphine and other kinds of opiates from there.</TEXT>

Edit: If you were depressed before, then you should've been put on an anti depressant AND an anti psychotic, but it's still kinda weird putting someone with Drug Induced Psychosis on anti depressants, especially if it wasn't caused by the depression (Psychotic depression).</TEXT>

MDMA and Coke can both cause psychosis if abused the way you abused them, and acid also can I believe, but more commonly it's usually HPPD with acid but psychosis can definitely happen with the use of acid as well.</TEXT>

I've even seen people that are allegedly in a psychosis come on reddit and type their thoughts, of course when I'm in a severe psychosis I don't say anything online about it and sometimes end up in hospital or... Worse, but I'm not in a CONSTANT severe psychosis that some people seem to think.</TEXT>

People in my family knew I was schizophrenic before any doc diagnosed me, so self diagnoses or semi self diagnoses or family diagnoses (in my case) can be helpful to the person and the doctor that will later diagnose you, well, in my case that's how it went.</TEXT>

And all you can do is get out of the house and get a psychiatrist AND psychologist and if you need one, someone that's educated on mindfulness, or research that form of meditation yourself and try it out while you're "in the dark" so to speak when it comes to meds. :)</TEXT>

Well, every time I was in the midst of a delusion and acting weird and strange, and very out there and you know, "paranoid", she would get angry and say, "you can't POSSIBLY blame your disorder/illness for this", I found this very insensitive and out right stupid.</TEXT>

As the disease progressed I would stop seeing people, essentially isolating and not washing and having thought issues, like word salad, and again she would look at me weirdly, scoff and say, "you can't blame schizophrenia *scoff*"... Funny thing is I never blamed schizophrenia at all.</TEXT>
