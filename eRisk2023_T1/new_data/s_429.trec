**TL;DR** - Objective is 1-2 sentences; Use standard fonts like Times New Roman or Arial; Include information that pertains specifically to the position for which you're applying (don't put in useless information just to "fill" your resume); Describe activities in terms of results and accomplishments; Show you're a "doer" by using action words such as "accomplished", "initiated", "established", etc when describing your activities; Make sure your resume format is consistent; Read the job description/advertisement for the job and use any words the employer used to describe the job; Grammar and spell check!;</TEXT>
