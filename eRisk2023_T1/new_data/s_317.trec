GamerGate was one of the biggest controversies in video gaming in 2014 and 2015, covered by a majority of mainstream media outlets, and heavily involved with overarching themes of harassment online and in video games that have gained notoriety in the last couple of years (which, itself, has been covered by outlets like Colbert and John Oliver and a fucking Law and Order: SVU episode)

(Note that if you, instead, tried to find Japanese works using the word "oni" instead of "yokai", there's a simllar bias towards " evil", because "oni" is a much closer translation of "demon")

Yokai, and its Chinese relatives, are a much more general word that describes the supernatural milieu of ghosts, spirits, monsters, demons,  sprites, etc.</TEXT>

(Some think, for example, that Cixin Liu's *Three Body Problem* [a great novel that was honestly a great example of the sort of sci-fi I think many people of all views would enjoy] might have garnered a nomination if it wasn't overran by on-slate nominations for Sad Puppy approved works)

It makes it so that if I don't want to reward bloc voting via slate, the only real choice, imo, is "no award".</TEXT>

(And in this specific case, I'd feel perfectly fine voting against works on the slate not because of their chosen ideological pedastal, but because they got there via voting bloc shenanigans)

With the publicity that this year's Hugo awards have been getting (especially in the circles that Kloos and others run), I'd find it extremely suspicious for any Sad Puppy nominee to continuing being "surprised" at being included, and to use "I wasn't aware" as an excuse to not make a statement one way or the other on the slate.</TEXT>

Due to the fact that TT set this game in the middle of Song of Ice and Fire proper, there's immense narrative pressure from the existing characters and plot points.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> It sounds like to me they just thought the opening was lackluster -- I mean, their problems with ep 1 are right there in the review:

 Characters and events are often brought up seemingly to remind the viewer that they're in Westeros, and not enough time is spent making us care about House Forrester before the characters are put in danger both direct and existential.</TEXT>

I think Telltale did a wonderful job with TWD in crafting a series of episodes that felt *important* from the get go, and not just a tertiary side story in a large narrative being played out somewhere else.</TEXT>

I think that's going to be much harder to do with GoT.  I'm certainly going to be playing it because I love both the books and tv episodes, but at the same time, I don't think I'll ever truly forget that this is, ultimately, a side story.</TEXT>

Some books that I think would be great seinen anime that takes itself more seriously:

* Abercrombie's First Law books
* Mark Lawrence's Broken Empire novels
* Steven Erikson's Malazan novels, if you imagine it done one a scale and breadth like Legend of the Galactic Heroes
* China Mieville's Bas-lag 

Some that would be great one-shot anime films:

* Guy Gavriel Kay's Tigana
* Beagle's The Last Unicorn
* American Gods by Neil Gaiman
* Stover's Heroes Die
* Zelazny's Lord of Light
* Heinlein's Glory Road
* Neverwhere by Neil Gaiman

To reiterate a link above, here is a handy white paper by Google that goes over what precisely happens when ads are served: https://support.google.com/dfp_premium/answer/1143651?hl=en

Now, I don't know how many of Gamastura's ads are direct sells vs remnant ads (besides Intel, which they've confirmed as a direct sell), but assuming that Gamasutra does have remnant advertising, this means that *Adsense ads might be served in the same slot as Intel ads*.</TEXT>

If that Intel ad gets enough impressions for the day according to DFP's calculations and forecasting, then to avoid overserving the ad, DFP might decide that to use Adsense ads instead, based on the line item selection critera mentioned above.</TEXT>

Last year, Full Sail did a study on this, and gave a talk about at at the GDC: https://archive.today/KSAXb  (Gamasutra link)

Metacritic's response (https://archive.today/Sbd12) denies the accuracy of Full Fail's estimates of site weight and tiers.</TEXT>

**My position:**

With the power given to Metacritic scores by both the gaming industry (ie, New Vegas), the gaming consumers ("what is this game's metacritic score"), and the gaming press (some publications have more power over the Metacritic score than others), it feels wrong to me that this is a proprietary score, without any accountability other than what Metacritic puts on itself.</TEXT>

There's no visibility into how a score is determined, no consumer/readership voice as to, in Metacritic's own words, a critic's "quality and overall stature".</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> Hell, Ebert in his review of the Lion King said: **""The saga of Simba, which in its deeply buried origins owes something to Greek tragedy and certainly to Hamlet"**

I present to to this Lion King review from *1994* from the *Washington Post*: http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/review96/lionkinghin.htm

Or this one:

Or this one from a few years back that's more a retrospective:

That said, I really do think that "feminism", being socially progressive, and criticism of games as a cultural artifacts, and a general misunderstanding -- purposeful or not -- of what those things actually mean are resulting in GamerGate.</TEXT>

But the key thing for me is that with today's social networks and the unique way that Twitter acts as both soapbox, megaphone and mailbox at the same time, along with articles like the above buzzfeed piece, a culture of  escalation of outrage is only prevalent, but also encouraged.</TEXT>

**What Happened**

Last week, in the Code A Finals and Code S semi-finals of GSL5, gom started to actively block VLC user agents from working.</TEXT>

Then, today, during the Day 1 Up/Down matches, GOM started to exclude everything but the GOMPlayer user agent.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_317_1374_14</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

There appear to be circumstantial evidence that GOM or someone notifying GOM is monitoring Reddit threads for workarounds to their blocking, and actively preventing new solutions for working for more than a short period of time.</TEXT>

**EDIT 2**:

Looks like in the middle of March 14's live stream, GOMTV once again changed it so that now going directly to the link results in a disconnect.</TEXT>

You can also get this to work on Linux by piping stream output directly to vlc.</TEXT>

In terminal:

    cd ~/Desktop
    mkfifo gomtv
    curl -o "http://yourgomtvstreamlink" gomtv

In VLC:

    File-Advanced Open File (or Command-Shift-O)
    Check the "Treat as a pipe rather than a file" link
    Browse to desktop and choose the gomtv file
    Open

If the named pipe times ou on curl, just restart it.</TEXT>
