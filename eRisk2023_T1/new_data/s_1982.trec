            	<TEXT>good, I would add a few notes - to the taxis: AAA are usable only if ordered by phone and price of the trip is confirmed by the operator, if taken from the street they have a tendency to rip off; if you can use data, download Liftago taxi app and use that - that post is 5 years old, now it is fairly common to pay 50 CZK for a large pilsner beer (wholesale price of pilsner in a keg is around 25 CZK per 0,5 litre of beer, so selling it cheaper than 45 crowns does not make too much sense)</TEXT>
