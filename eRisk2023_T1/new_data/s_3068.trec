**Zombie** - Joyce Carol Oates (She's writing a journal as Jeffrey Dahmer)

**Daddy Love** - Joyce Carol Oates (It's about a little boy who is kidnapped by a rapist and held captive for years)

**We Need to Talk about Kevin** - Lionel Shriver (Mother writes to husband about what went wrong in parenting an eventual school shooting organizer)

**Out** - Natsuo Kirino (OH SNAP, you need to read this one if you like disturbing lit... Group of women from factory help a woman dispose of the body of her abusive husband, crazy shit ensues)

**The Collector** - John Fowles (this one will kill you if you're a serious redditor... you see the main character's mentality displayed here often (man wins lottery, kidnaps dream girl))

**Little Star** - John Ajvide Lindqvist (Although all of his books are worth your time (Old man goes mushrooming, finds a baby half buried in the woods, instead of crying she sings out a perfect note... he decides it's his fate to raise her in his basement as a sort of musical experiment, violence ensues))

**White as Snow** - Tanith Lee (Snow White re-write)

I don't think you're right in your thought that the money saved would be funneled back to the working class through their employers, that's pretty idealistic.</TEXT>

-Won't be as prone to run away from home

-Won't bleed on your furniture

-Can't have unexpected puppies

-Won't die from complications of birth (lots of dogs, like English Bulldogs, need assistance up to and including surgery to give birth to a litter)

-Stabilized mood

Cons


-Can be expensive if you don't qualify for financial assistance
