Once an honest man could go from sunrise to its set 
Without encountering agents of his state or government 
But a sorry cloud of tyranny has fallen across the land 
Brought on by hollow men, who did not understand 
That for centuries our forefather have fought and often died 
To keep themselves unto themselves, to fight the rising tide 
And that if in the smallest battles we surrender to the state 
We enter in a darkness whence we never shall escape

One of my favorite quotes on this point from the song Sons of Liberty.</TEXT>
