You don't really need an Orchid if your E/R drops multiple heroes by 700 health (most likely over half of their health pool pre 20 minutes even on carries) in a half second, and the buildup of Aghs is easier than Hex.</TEXT>

 Linkens is nice i guess but there is plenty of mechanism for poping it

Linkens after Orchid would have given Storm damage, control and more survivability because with repel on, the only thing that could pop linkens would be the diffusal.</TEXT>

SB/Blink in, Orchid, Pounce/Dark Pact, wait for DP damage to stop ticking, activate MoM. 

Retards build MoM and use it before Dark Pact and end up killing themselves, but if you're not bad maybe it could work, especially in conjunction with Shadow Dance because nobody can physically attack you, you'd just need to avoid AoE or point target spells.</TEXT>

I would love the opportunity to try that out because I play so much fucking better if I have a supportive team around me that cooperates with a game plan rather than playing completely solo, but nobody wants a 2.8k scrub on their team even if I offer to play support :( 

There are so many games I could have won if the 4 randoms on my team would have pushed towers or taken Roshan after a team fight rather than going back to farm.</TEXT>

123456 - spells (Played WoW for 4 years where your spells took up 1 through =, so hitting the 5 or 6 is already muscle memory and not an issue at all)

TAB - select all units

CAPSLOCK - cycle through units

Space - Select Hero

Q - attack move

E - Stop/Cancel

ZXCVFR - items

WASD - Camera Move

Basically the difference I'm seeing is that if I use mouse movement, that frees up 4 buttons to use for control groups.</TEXT>
