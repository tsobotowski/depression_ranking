The real 'genius' (if you can call it that) of this deal is that it'll cost workers far more in taxes and medical bills than $35.00 per year to cover the cost of environmental damage to public roads and other property caused by things like climate change and acid rain as well as the costs and pain from increased pollutants in our water and air causing cancers, breathing problems, deformities, etc...

 All that to save less than a dime a day.</TEXT>

The NW cloak that the weapons were wrapped in wasn't rotted so that indicates it was a newer cloak that would have probably come from a recently killed or still living crow, which strongly suggests Benjen.</TEXT>
