            	<TEXT> I don't think Pinhead is put alongside Meyers, Freddy, and Jason because he's a slasher villain like them (I'd kind of hesitate to put Freddy in there to, because he's so much more supernatural how he gets his victims is way different), I think it probably has to do with him being nigh invincible, and/or the fact that he has such a signature look that he's instantly recognizable.</TEXT>

You guys seem to actually give a shit about the quality of the game (a patch made with player input just a few days after the game came out), own up to mistakes (I saw one of the devs apologizing to a guy who got a bit screwed over by the patch that broke his game), and are working on making the game playable before monetizing it, unlike just about every other beta/early access game on Steam.</TEXT>
