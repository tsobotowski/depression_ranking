2 suggestions:

1) Ask the moderation team of NoSleep to see if any of them would like to help you mod your sub.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_891_243_2</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Just so that way you can make some type of connection piece and not be seen as a place that is trying to take subs from NoSleep.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_891_243_3</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

2) Make sure you find someone that is proficient at CSS (or if you are then even better)

Good luck!</TEXT>

But it's hard to remember 



The good times over the bad 



The times of happiness over sad 



Why we get up and continue to live 



Is harder as we have to give 



And never really ever get 



Except a bunch of regret 



But fear not ol' wounded soul 



Life is much better with a bowl

And some thread into flesh

We took a step back

With a twinkle in our eyes

Several piles of meat

Sit on the cold gray floor

As the fire starts to grow

A sweet smell fills the air

Body parts of past mods

Eaten by the hungry flames

With the last thread done

Valka has been made!</TEXT>
