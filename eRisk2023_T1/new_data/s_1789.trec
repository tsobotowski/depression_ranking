I'll keep it nice and simple:

EPA was planning on taking costs into account at the next stage of the MATS development.</TEXT>

So this simply rearranges the timeline, doesn't invalidate the MATS and certainly doesn't change anything about CPP.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1789_291_1</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Because like I just said, this [kicks out one of the legs of the CPP plaintiff's arguments](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-06-24/obama-may-win-by-losing-in-quirk-of-supreme-court-epa-review), that since coal plants are regulated under MATS they can't be under CPP.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>So unless you're seeing some  way for a new lawsuit because of the MATS ruling (which would be novel because IIRC the CPP already did the cost accounting that MATS didn't yet ) then I think you're mistaken.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1789_291_3</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

If you did mean MATS, then it's still not accurate since this ruling just kicked the suit back down to the DC court to make the EPA consider costs now instead of later when designing the enforcement.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>DC court may throw out the rule, but since it upheld the rule last time it's not likely to toss it now, but instead will probably just tell the EPA to go count costs, thereby just delaying enforcement.</TEXT>
