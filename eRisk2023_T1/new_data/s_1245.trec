            	<TEXT>Hang the artwork lower on the wall it looks really high up, move it down closer to the couch or add more artwork to make a gallery wall below what is already there, pull the couch off the wall and more into the center of the room (maybe move the chair out of the way and slide the couch toward the window wall so it doesn't block the door then put the small round tables where the chair was before and on the other side of the couch), mount the TV on the wall so it is higher up and hide all the cords/cables, add a floating shelf above the wall-mounted TV, maybe replace chair with a larger chair and larger coffee table to fill the space a little more, pull the rug into the center of the room and move the sofa with it away from the wall, it seems like everything is a little small for the size of the room since it is all pushed against walls.</TEXT>
