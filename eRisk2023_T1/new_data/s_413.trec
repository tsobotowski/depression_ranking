I'm not really sure what you mean by 'humanist' film makers, but these two spring to mind:

Sean Durkin *Martha Marcy May Marlene* (2011)

Abel Ferrara *Bad Lieutenant* (1992)

My own theory is that LLL was intended simply as a loving homage to Los Angeles, using a template provided by Scorsese's New York New York - a loving homage to New York (I would go so far as to suggest Chazelle *wants* us to make the comparison - I mean *New York New York* - *L.A L.A* - it's in the title!).</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>My ultimate criticism would be, therefore, that I left the cinema without a real feeling of L.A. I wasn't inspired by Chazelle's vision of the city - I didn't feel I knew anything unique about its spirit or its character.</TEXT>

First attempt at this tart was not good because (I now realise) my oven cools down very slowly, so when it came to putting the tart into the 150C oven (after it had been at 200C for the pastry) the oven was still too hot and the tart overbaked.</TEXT>

Next attempt - the tart was beautiful on top - dark, glossy, and thrillingly wobbly (I'm lucky enough to have two ovens so I used them both - one hot one cool) but on attempting to serve I watched in horror as the Cajeta ran out of the case in a steady stream and pooled on the table top.</TEXT>

To cut a long and painful story short, every attempt since has featured not only similarly runny cajeta, but in addition the top of the tart has started to crack about 5 - 10 minutes out of the oven and cajeta has oozed to the surface creating scary big K shaped cracks that mirror perfectly the slowly forming cracks in my mental health as a successful version of this potentially show-stopping tart continues to evade me.</TEXT>

First attempt at this tart was not good because (I now realise) my oven cools down very slowly, so when it came to putting the tart into the 150C oven (after it had been at 200C for the pastry) the oven was still too hot and the tart overbaked.</TEXT>

Next attempt - the tart was beautiful on top - dark, glossy, and thrillingly wobbly (I'm lucky enough to have two ovens so I used them both - one hot one cool) but on attempting to serve I watched in horror as the Cajeta ran out of the case in a steady stream and pooled on the table top.</TEXT>

The 'mysticism' you talk of in your first point - I'm not sure I agree if audiences enjoy that kind of ambiguity as much as you claim, although you do describe them as 'feigning' a deep connection to a film like *Tree Of Life*, so maybe you are hinting there's an element of pretentiousness at play?</TEXT>

Further edit: [Example of what I mean](https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/recipes/chicken-mustard-poulet-la-moutarde/14048/) - OK so when you add the browning time to the cooking time you get 40 - 45 minutes, but even this leaves my chicken nowhere near cooked through!</TEXT>

I think the distinction you make between horror and what we loosely think of as 'arthouse' (whatever that is) can be made between arthouse and other film genres - for example action movies or romcom.</TEXT>
