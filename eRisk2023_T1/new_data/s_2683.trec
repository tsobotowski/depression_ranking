The point here is that I share the same affinity for vw's as everyone else here, and while I don't have the budget to do a full rebuild, I'm still enjoying working on a car within my limits... :/

Edit: Also if you'd like to know where I started with this car, I'd be happy to pm anyone some "before" pictures in the morning, since apparently I need to prove myself since this picture doesn't show a step by step of my build....</TEXT>
