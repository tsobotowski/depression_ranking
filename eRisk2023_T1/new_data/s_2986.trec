- girlfriend is, like most women, attracted to you because you appear confident and self-reliant
- as you become comfortable in the relationship you tell her some of the horrible shit that has happened to you which gets you down, and you seek some emotional support
- girlfriend completely loses all respect for you because you're not 100% made of steel, and leaves you for some brofag with 'more confidence' who actually just has the emotional capacity of a brick</TEXT>

There are obvious reasons like the ridiculous risk of STDs with that many partners - protection isn't foolproof and you're vastly increasing your statistical chances - but, and this is probably where people will disagree, I think that having sex with *that many* different partners reduces the value of the emotional connection inherent in the act, and sex goes from positive to degrading.</TEXT>

And I think some 'slut shaming' of men is fairly obvious - if women don't like being sexually objectified (and who would) and the way that affects them in society, then stop treating every one of them like an achievement, and your life like you have a pokedex of vaginas you need to complete.</TEXT>

This is important because a man with a sexually attractive body is attractive all the time, and knows he is - whereas women who feel that they are only attractive with makeup (despite the fact that they're probably fine without it) can become very dependent on it for their self esteem and feel uncomfortable or exposed without it.</TEXT>
