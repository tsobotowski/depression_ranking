Again, bear with me as these may be blatant/obvious but here's a couple things that stood out to me in both films:
Both start out with young pre-teen girls moving or having just moved to a new location
Said girls are loathe to move because they are leaving behind friends
Both have parents that are either un-attentive or outright dismissive
Both go through a tunnel that leads to a different world of sorts
Both meet a boy that either helps or guides them in their journey at different points
Both have to rescue their parents from a malevolent mother type figure through a test or game
I thought there were some interesting contrast as well: Coraline is initially sold on this other world pretty quickly but increasingly comes to find it a terrible place while Chihiro is scared of being there and increasingly comes to find it comforting.</TEXT>

The acting is superb, and the dialogue very endearing, being from the same guy who screenplayed 2009's an education (also a good movie to watch)

One thing I'm bothered by is that I wish the movie hadn't made the decision for saoirse's character to leave Ireland and go back to America because that spiteful old lady found out she was married and was seemingly intending to blackmail her and/or just be a huge nosy nelly gossip.</TEXT>

I did feel slightly betrayed when the weird sisters turned out to be not really that altruistic and were just manipulating Macbeth and Demona for *centuries*, all culminating in them getting the 3 sources of power for the arch-mage villain (eye of Odin, book of grimorum, and the Phoenix gate) 

This led to the avalon storyline, a great one, which in turned led to Angela, one of my favorite newly introduced gargoyles (I love how sweet she is, indicating that a home of love and nurture is key to how good a person can be, contrasting with Demona) 

THAT led in turn to the 20 episode arc that could have been a season all its own in which Goliath, Elisa, Bronx, and Angela travel on a boat to many different locales, solving problems throughout each area, coming toe to toe with the pack, xanatos , and assorted other villain, but also other gargoyles!</TEXT>

- Dorkly for video game related humor

- How it should have ended (also for movies)

- TeamFourStar's DBZ Abridged and Hellsing Abridged for hilarious takes on said shows

- ASAPscience and/or vsauce for anything sciency related

- collegehumor's 2009-2011 videos for just generally fun silly type comedy

- smbc theater

The last 2 don't really update anymore but they have some classic stuff from a decade ago that I find rather hilarious.</TEXT>

That scene where Maui makes his pecs dance, that was the moment I knew the Rock voiced him even if I didn't know the rock was in this movie simply because that is *such* a thing The Rock would do lol.</TEXT>

And though the song is essentially to trick Moana and steal her boat and leave her trapped in a cave (without even a box of scraps) I still can't help loving it and being captivated by him.</TEXT>

But yeah everything about this movie is completely on point, I haven't felt this great about a Disney movie since they released another amazing stellar movie in the same year (Zootopia) what was up with them releasing 2 fantastic movies in one year instead of spacing them out and not letting them compete with each other over the same oscar.</TEXT>

It seems like such a little thing, but when you're playing a text heavy jrpg with a lot of reading, or a visual novel, or text adventure, or whatever it may be, you don't want to be constantly waiting for the text to scroll, since most people don't just read one word or letter at a time, we take it all in...

I dunno, it's just one of those things in video games, like crappy sound mixing and tiny font, that no one ever complains about despite it being a pressing problem that hasn't been fixed and keeps getting worse.</TEXT>

I mean, it's simply inexcusable in this day and age, when even the best movies, with their great plot lines and fantastic characters, tend to suffer this western trait of having sloppy editing, shaky cam (bourne series ugh) all over the place, and jump cuts that really distort more than enhance the experience to make the viewer believe they're actually witnessing a fight scene.</TEXT>

I don't know if there's a proper solution since martial art prowess takes years to master and Western movies are on a tight schedule, but I just... I just don't think shaky cam and quick editing and the worst of them all, shooting in the dark to mask the terrible editing/fighting, is the answer.</TEXT>

3) And finally the third, disappointing one (though one could argue potc at least had a better resolution than... whatever matrix 3 was)

It's not uncommon for trilogies to do this so you'll notice a lot of similarities with other franchises (particularly the sequel hook, that's a given) but I thought matrix and potc in particular shared a lot more than the usual.</TEXT>

Like any visual medium, porn should make use of the imagination, it's not just what's on the surface, it's also what's implied, it's about seeing more than just the colors onscreen, the visual medium of movies offers both sight and sound and something deeper, atmosphere, that can only be created with a right combination of the many elements that make up a video.</TEXT>

Lizzy Caplan's Julia from season 1 was basically the same role first, a lot prettier, a lot funnier, and should have been on the show a lot longer (they just wrote her out so poorly, but they do that with all the good boyfriends and girlfriends of nick/jess for some reason, they just don't know how to write them out organically)
I'm invested in the show so it really bothers that fox hasn't left yet, just do the break up already.</TEXT>

However RE 4 went through around 6 years of development time (and this was early 2000s, so inflation of development time in mind this would be like 12 years with today's expensive technology and subsequent long development times) and got scrapped several times, with one of the scrapped designs actually ending up being a whole new game (Devil May Cry) which I definitely think is downright unheard of and unique in the video game industry.</TEXT>

As a matter of fact I thought the second movie's scenes with the dragon were by far the only good part of the entire 3 hobbit movies, and benedict cucumberbatch really knocked it out of the park, he's been a great actor these past 6 years.</TEXT>

What I like from European porn or X-Art/Joymii/Sexart is when the partners are actually caressing each other, kissing a lot (which is my favorite thing) and slowly go from foreplay to intense passion, there's an actual buildup to it instead of disgusting mainstream American porn where the guy slaps his dick on the girl's face.</TEXT>

I won't even get into Toy Story 3, an unnecessary movie that basically copies a lot of elements of Toy Story 2 (toying with the idea of them no longer being played by andy, a villain pretending to be nice but was the villain this whole time manipulating his underlings, etc etc) and never needed to be made because Toy Story 2 ended the series so perfectly "whatever happens, as long as I've got you buzz we'll face it together, to infinity and beyond"

I dunno.</TEXT>

I dunno, the movie feels all over the place and unfocused, especially when they add in digitally restored scenes never seen before, like a scene with a Jewish chauffeur talking to De Niro's character about how there's no need to be a gangster "like the Italians" in his words, so with stuff like that I can't even gauge what the movie wants to be.</TEXT>

I mean yeah most of the characters are portrayed as complete "preppy" (their words) tools of a seemingly dying yuppie culture, and I found the redhaired guy particularly annoying in his egotistical idiocy and beliefs, but at the end of the movie when all the girls have moved on and the 3 guys have a depressing night out by themselves... I dunno that kind of rejection is very familiar to me on a personal level and I felt really depressed even if I didn't necessarily like these characters.</TEXT>

Also the exiting of the nick character (chris eigeman) earlier in the movie is a shame since he was the best part of the movie, as he plays a more likable abrasive character in comparison to his character in the last days of disco.</TEXT>

All the movies I mentioned in this topic are also great, but I chose to single out Damsels in Distress just because it's one of those movies where you rewatch it just to see things you miss the first time, like the expressions and faces that all the actors make at something Greta Gerwig's character says, or the fact that said "damsels" in the movie are so lovely your eyes keep darting from one to the other to take it all in.</TEXT>

All the movies I mentioned in this topic are also great, but I chose to single out Damsels in Distress just because it's one of those movies where you rewatch it just to see things you miss the first time, like the expressions and faces that all the actors make at something Greta Gerwig's character says, or the fact that said "damsels" in the movie are so lovely your eyes keep darting from one to the other to take it all in.</TEXT>

One of my favorite scenes is the hallway scene where you realize how she is skilled at manipulating a guy to control him since that's what she wants, I thought that was a really well done scene and probably the only time an incredibly arousing scene in a movie actually furthered the story and character development instead of just providing titillation (which as don jon so truthfully stated, could be gotten from pornographic content much more easily)

And the shattered expectations of don jon as he realizes that being super gorgeous isn't exactly the greatest foundation of a relationship on, in addition to learning about why he engages in his own vices, is something I enjoyed as well.</TEXT>

Plus considering Maleficent is the only great thing about Sleeping Beauty (which is really more of a story about the 3 fairies vs Maleficent, which is why I like the fairies so much and the story focuses on them more so than the prince and princess), she's more "awesome cool" villain a la Jafar, rather than "terrifying, gave me nightmares as a kid" villain like Ursula did back in the 90s with the little mermaid.</TEXT>

I mean it's perhaps not that uncommon worldwide but I finally felt the uncomfortable feeling Carla felt when she realized she was like turk's mom, and that angle coupled with just how much older she is than turk made the whole den mother thing she has make a lot more sense in a literal manner, since she really is that much older than him.</TEXT>

Both of these copied Scrubs in terms of having voice overs at the beginning and end of every episode, or having an arrogant jerk of a doctor who is still around the hospital because he's just that good and also has a bit of a god complex, I mean Dr Cox was basically House before that show even aired, complete with an addiction to alcohol as opposed to painkillers for House.</TEXT>

While these 2 shows were pulling great ratings, Scrubs was in danger of being canceled on NBC nearly every season, to the point where at the end it really did end its run on NBC and ABC picked up the show instead, giving fans proper closure to the series as opposed to the terrifying way that season 7 ended.</TEXT>

But I remember when I first played Episode 1, they had a pretty interesting setup with: 

- the gnosis phenomenon

- Shion's character and her traumatic history as well as emotional baggage from Kevin leading into her connection with Kosmos

- Kosmos herself, and all the mysteries surrounding her architecture

- Realians and their rights, as well as prejudice against them as seen by Lieutenant Virgil, which I thought was going to be a larger part of the story since they focused so heavily on it at the beginning (but ultimately... was not)

- Jr (one of my favorite if not favorite character, and a very interesting backstory with URTVs, U-DO, genetic mutation and tampering, etc etc)

- Ziggy's backstory

- Momo and the connection to Joachim Mizrahi

- The subcommittee which I felt had some parallels with those red and blue floating orb heads in Xenogears that were monitoring Fei and co, although the subcommittee's role ended up being extremely small and restricted to show only Juli Mizrahi, and I feel they made her a lot less... cold than she was in Episode 1, which weirdly enough I actually didn't like because her character seemed completely different (ironically the reverse happened with Shion, but ultimately both had a similar negative impression on me)

- Albedo, who is still one of JRPG's and general video game's best villain of all time, gruesomely psychotic and you love every minute of it, not to mention the splendid voice actor that gives it his all for the role

- Chaos and the mystery surrounding him

- Vector's president and the identities of the people in the hoods, 2 new colors (black and white) that are shown in Episode 2, and then all revealed in Episode 3.</TEXT>

I love nightman because it's the very first episode I ever saw, just a random episode from this show I knew nothing about, and I initially thought the premise was "struggling/out of work actors doing an  off off off-broadway type musical" due to the nature of the episode, before finding out the actual premise as I watched the older episodes.</TEXT>

It's just that, by not doing this, it seems like the villain of season 2 is actually Beaver, with just an offhanded remark that "oh he got molested and that's why he is the way he is"

I just felt that season 2 was too ambitious in that regard, it wasn't as tightly crafted as season 1 while still having an insanely shocking (but still fits) revelation with the Logan's dad having sex with his son's girlfriend thing.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> He's the only character that sticks with Liz until the end and she ends up marrying him, finally achieving a happy ending with this guest star (guest star boyfriends/girlfriends in shows are usually only for a couple of episodes and then that's it)

But here's the thing; like  Sean Bean, James Marsden had a running joke in the movie world back in the 2000s where he, a generally nice guy, never ends up with the girl.</TEXT>

You've got The Notebook where this happens, you've got Superman Returns where he plays the boyfriend of Lois Lane while Superman is away, and even in the X-Men series you had his girlfriend Jean Grey flirting with Wolverine and then that thing that happens at the end of the 2nd movie.</TEXT>

So in a ton of movies where the girl ends up choosing some other guy despite James Marsden being an extremely decent fellow and (usually) a much better person than the guy the girl chose, it's like Tina Fey made a reference to this by having James Marsden on the show and not leaving him but actually ended up marrying him and adopting a kid together.</TEXT>

So we all know Hans is the bad guy and this scene does foreshadow it:

And that's fair, but the scene in the beginning where Hans falls in the water and smiles at his horse, there was no one around to see that, whose benefit was that for, the audience?</TEXT>

I do like the movie but I can't help but wonder how awesome it would be for River's badassness to gradually progress as we saw hints of it in the show, culminating in the badass warrior she became by like, the 3rd or 4th season, or something like that.</TEXT>

I hope it's not true, because Coach's inclusion in season 4 really shifted the dynamic and made the show even more fantastic than thought possible, and as hilarious as it is for 5 people to live in one tiny loft with only 1 bathroom, they had a lot of great stories with the characters.</TEXT>
