No, the author isn't claiming that nobody used the cosmological argument because it was stupid: he is saying that there are gross misrepresentations of the cosmological argument which are put forward as straw men, and then knocked down, and that it's disingenuous to treat this as the "real" version, and then say that arguments as they were actually presented by major proponents as an attempt to patch the original up.</TEXT>

*"As therefore any one who takes and recasts a golden statue which has been tarnished by time, smoke, dust, rust, restores it to us thoroughly cleansed and glistening: so too this nature of ours, rusted with the rust of sin, and having gathered much smoke from our faults, and having lost its beauty, which He had from the beginning bestowed upon it from himself, God has taken and cast anew, and throwing it into the waters as into a mould, and instead of fire sending forth the grace of the Spirit, then brings us forth with much brightness, renewed, and made afresh, to rival the beams of the sun, having crushed the old man, and having fashioned a new man, more brilliant than the former.*</TEXT>

St Basil of Caesarea, (~329-379) in his [9th Homily on the Six Days](http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/32019.htm), gives the anatomy of predators as an example of God's creative power, and I think he can be taken as implying that carnivory is a necessary aspect of these creature's lives:

*"If you examine the members even of animals, you will find that the Creator has given them nothing superfluous, that He has omitted nothing that is necessary.</TEXT>

St Thomas Aquinas, (1225-1274) certainly no theological scrub, seems to have taken a similar view in his [Summa Theologica](http://dhspriory.org/thomas/summa/FP/FP096.html#FPQ96A1THEP1):

*"In the opinion of some, those animals which now are fierce and kill others, would, in that state* [i.e. prior to the Fall] *, have been tame, not only in regard to man, but also in regard to other animals.</TEXT>

I mean, to take an example that you would be readily familiar with, let's compare the incredible depth of learning and attention to detail that somebody like Joseph Felsenstein brings to bear in his comments on these issues, to Richard Dawkins' ["Behe is a fraud 'cos wolves change heaps"](https://np.reddit.com/r/DebateEvolution/comments/4rs07n/medicine_validates_evolutionary_mechanisms/d5fqt5o/) in his NYT review of TEoE. And you'll still see people citing the latter as some kind of "knock-down" refutation.</TEXT>

Biologists speak of mutations being "random" and by this, it is not meant that every base has an equal probability of 
mutation: rather it refers to the probability of a mutation occuring at any given base not being affected by whether the mutation will confer selective advantage or disadvantage in its current environment.</TEXT>

On the topic of post facto predictions, I agree that predictions which are "risky" and made before the fact are certainly *more* valuable, but to make predictions in the sense of being able to point out how your theory might explain certain observations after they have been observed is also valuable too in science, isn't it?</TEXT>

I think that this incongruency arises because there is a disconnect between the way these people are presented and the way they really are:

To ascribe to Kim Jong Il that, for example, he is the true source of all good things in North Korea seems wrong because it is ultimately, an untruth: he is but a sinful fellow creature.</TEXT>

You now say that you were thinking of his debate with Krauss, but, contrary to what you said here, Craig does not, as you said, start out his debate with Krauss by discussing the premise "everything that begins to exist has a cause" and then redirecting to the Leibnizian argument when he has been addressed on the former front: it's Leibnizian from the very start.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>In chapter 18 of his book Grace and Free Will he writes:

*Unintelligent persons, however, with regard to the apostle's statement: We conclude that a man is justified by faith without the works of the law, Romans 3:28 have thought him to mean that faith suffices to a man, even if he lead a bad life, and has no good works.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_753_1018_3</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

In the same work he goes on to ask *If eternal life is rendered to good works, as the Scripture most openly declares: "Then He shall reward every man according to his works" Matthew 16:27, how can eternal life be a matter of grace, seeing that grace is not rendered to works, but is given gratuitously, as the apostle himself tells us: "To him that works is the reward not reckoned of grace, but of debt" Romans 4:4, and again: "There is a remnant saved according to the election of grace" with these words immediately subjoined: "And if of grace, then is it no more of works; otherwise grace is no more grace?"</TEXT>

*"As therefore any one who takes and recasts a golden statue which has been tarnished by time, smoke, dust, rust, restores it to us thoroughly cleansed and glistening: so too this nature of ours, rusted with the rust of sin, and having gathered much smoke from our faults, and having lost its beauty, which He had from the beginning bestowed upon it from himself, God has taken and cast anew, and throwing it into the waters as into a mould, and instead of fire sending forth the grace of the Spirit, then brings us forth with much brightness, renewed, and made afresh, to rival the beams of the sun, having crushed the old man, and having fashioned a new man, more brilliant than the former.*</TEXT>

St John Chrysostom wrote in his "Instructions to Catechumens":

*"As therefore any one who takes and recasts a golden statue which has been tarnished by time, smoke, dust, rust, restores it to us thoroughly cleansed and glistening: so too this nature of ours, rusted with the rust of sin, and having gathered much smoke from our faults, and having lost its beauty, which He had from the beginning bestowed upon it from himself, God has taken and cast anew, and throwing it into the waters as into a mould, and instead of fire sending forth the grace of the Spirit, then brings us forth with much brightness, renewed, and made afresh, to rival the beams of the sun, having crushed the old man, and having fashioned a new man, more brilliant than the former.*</TEXT>

If the other side are correct that marriage is objectively between a man and a woman, then nobody is "fighting against equality" when they seek for that to ethical truth be upheld in the law.</TEXT>

What I'm trying to say is that, when a naturalist thinks that they have encountered a genuine instance of empathy (i.e. one with a real human, not a rock with a disguise) which provides a justification for treating them differently to an inanimate object, naturalism inescapably leads to the conclusion: "**You have no ground for that belief**:
you have been tricked into thinking that the human being is qualitatively different from other physical systems which it is clearly **not** cruel to treat in this way (blocks of marble, clouds of helium gas, pools of tar, and so on)

A naturalist might, as you have done, put forward the bare description "I happen to experience certain pleasurable sensations when I think I have found the truth or when I help others"

But this leads to the further question "Why are pleasurable sensations objectively good?"</TEXT>

All discussion is dependent on the truth of certain propositions like "I and you possess selfhood" and "it is objectively good to seek the truth", and thus if naturalism ends up denying these propositions it's not that therefore it's emotionally unpalatable: it's that it's an incoherent belief system.</TEXT>

You also said that it is "simpler" to use a naturalistic explanation rather than to "invoke gods"

I certainly agree that if we take a scenario like: 

"there exist certain arrangements of matter which display certain states 
(which those arrangements of matter call "empathy" or "anguish") because producing those effects
under certain circumstances is an effective
way (or at least, the byproduct of an effective way) for particular sequences of nucleic acids to
perpetuate themselves."</TEXT>

And, taking a broad definition of the word "god" we add to that scenario "An immaterial being more powerful than humans who has some kind of interest in human affairs"

I totally agree that adding in a "god" to this picture doesn't help: the physical account already explains things entirely.</TEXT>

Similarly, saying that moral sensations "aren't flippant" is to commit the same mistake, on this scheme: the fact that aggregates of matter have particular arrangements which produce effects which we call "anguish" or that such effects occur with regularity (i.e. are "deeply ingrained") doesn't show that they are ultimately qualitatively different from 200 degrees Celsius causing the effect of gas release from mineral X 80% of the time.</TEXT>

I think we can unpack this objection by asking: why *is* the self-aggrandisement of the North Korean leaders
so bad, anyway?</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_753_1563_11</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Let me submit that it is because there is an incongruency between the way they are presented
and the way they really are:

To ascribe to Kim Jong Il that, for example, he is the 
*true source* of all good things in North Korea seems wrong because it is ultimately, an untruth: he is but a sinful fellow creature.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_753_1563_12</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

That is, it's so absurd precisely because he  is *not God*.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_753_1563_13</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

And so, I think the Christian can quite happily agree that if God were merely an immaterial version of Kim Jong Il, then He would indeed not be worthy of worship, but that in terms of addressing the internal consistency of Christianity, the objection doesn't hit home.</TEXT>
        </DOC>

            	<DOCNO>s_753_1563_14</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>


**Emotional neediness**

Another aspect of this argument is an alleged contradiction between the perfection of God, and Gods command to worship Him.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_753_1563_15</DOCNO>

            	<DOCNO>s_753_1563_16</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Again, I think the Christian can partially agree with this argument: if God was the kind of being that commanded people to worship Him on the basis of personal insecurity, then that *would* seem to contradict with Him being perfect.</TEXT>

Given that there are 4 standard nucleotides, and assuming a random distribution of nucleotides in the sequence, the probability of getting a given 4 nucleotide sequence will be (1/4)^4, and for a 5 bp sequence it will be (1/4)^5,

My comment: I think Rupke is correct insofar as, even if you have some disagreements with it, you can follow the structure of Darwins argument concerning vertebrate skeletons, and the argument itself certainly isn't circular.</TEXT>

While there is a grain of truth to this objection, in that one frequently encounters formulations of this kind of argument which describe the characteristic in question as having "less efficiency than wed expect or something similar, rather than saying "no function", I still think it's true that we also find the latter formulation as well.</TEXT>

I will concede that there is a lot of conceptual overlap between ID and creationism, and it seems that a creationist textbook ("Of Pandas and People" ) was rejigged to become an ID textbook after Edwards vs Aguillard, but I think that this is just one point of data, and can't be used to characterise the whole issue.</TEXT>

I hope I'm not preempting you falsely, but  one thought typically given by a lot of atheists in this line of discussion is something along the lines of

"Yeah, I know that all my impulses are ultimately meaningless physical phenomena, but that 
doesn't stop me finding meaning in loving my spouse and children/making artwork/learning new things"

However, all this is just a personal report that you happen to experience "feelings of meaning".</TEXT>

Firstly, the reason that many pro-life conservatives in the US are opposed to publically funded initiatives for mothers and children is not because they don't care about children post-birth: it's that they believe that privately funded initiatives will be more appropriate.</TEXT>

Had I the heavens' embroidered cloths,

Enwrought with golden and silver light,

The blue and the dim and the dark cloths

Of night and light and the half-light,

I would spread the cloths under your feet:

But I, being poor, have only my dreams;

I have spread my dreams under your feet;

Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.</TEXT>

I have no doubt that Behe's ideas about what natural selection is capable of have flaws in them somewhere, but however flawed they are, they are always going to be better than a 19th century view which contains **no** real attempt at quantifying of what natural selection is capable of , which Dawkins tried to pass off as being adequate in his review of tEoE, and which is repeated in textbooks as being a good argument.</TEXT>

That diagram is an example of **exactly what I was talking about in my initial post**: it lists a few types of eye that are similar at the level of gross anatomy, but does absolutely nothing to show what kind of changes have to occur at the molecular level to build up, say, a lens or cornea.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> I guess what I take issue with is something along the following lines

David Swift, an English environmental scientist, writes in his book 'Evolution Under The Microscope': 

*"Darwin, being aware of morphological variations that arise naturally, but knowing nothing of the underlying genetic 
mechanisms or biochemical implications, believed that biological tissues are innately plastic.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_753_1935_1</DOCNO>

Also, from the success of domestic breeding it was evident that variations are heritable
and that significant morphological change can be acheived by repeated (artificial) selection.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_753_1935_2</DOCNO>

achieved through the selection and accumulation of small beneficial variations.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>In effect he
believed there was no fundamental limit to the plasticity of biological tissues: morphological
change was limited only by the viability of the resulting structure*

*...Unfortunately, many contemporary biologists, although they are aware of the genetic and biochemical
aspects of variations, still follow the uninformed 19th-century view when it comes to considering
the origin of new morphological structures."*</TEXT>

I will concede that there is a lot of conceptual overlap between ID and creationism, and it seems that a creationist textbook ("Of Pandas and People" ) was rejigged to become an ID textbook after Edwards vs Aguillard, but I think that this is just one point of data, and can't be used to characterise the whole issue.</TEXT>

- the "novel complex trait" of the Cit(+) strain [was caused by a mutation of a regulatory sequence](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22992527) which caused the transporter to also be expressed under aerobic conditions, and doesn't involve building up new biochemical machinery.</TEXT>
