            	<TEXT>I also like to name monsters, despite the fact they might be quickly dispatched, it does sometimes add a bit of colour to a game when and where it is appropriate to use a named monster "Old Okrak the Umberhaulk is up to his tricks again, he should have perished in the great mine collapse 20 years ago but he still roams those tunnels".</TEXT>
