I am fully prepared to get burned in wildfire for these opinions but that's what they are guys opinions try not to kill me for them as I've also said I'm hoping to see the Targaryens come out on top **all of them** And there is definitely room for redemption in the TV show perhaps through Jon helping her find her more gentle and clear headed side as opposed to being all passion and fire (aka a dragon ) and in the books perhaps Jon as well or more likely I feel through Ser Bariston seeing as he is still with us in the world of the books.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Let's take a look at the song lyrics (feel free to skip if you don't feel like reading it all): Uptown got its hustlers The Bowery got its bums 42nd Street got Big Jim Walker He's a pool-shootin' son of a gun Yeah, he big and dumb as a man can come But he stronger than a country hoss And when the bad folks all get together at night You know they all call big Jim "Boss", just because And they say You don't tug on Superman's cape You don't spit into the wind You don't pull the mask off that old Lone Ranger And you don't mess around with Jim Well outta south Alabama come a country boy He say I'm lookin' for a man named Jim I am a pool-shootin' boy My name's Willie McCoy But down home they call me Slim Yeah I'm lookin' for the king of 42nd Street He drivin' a drop top Cadillac Last week he took all my money And it may sound funny But I come to get my money back And everybody say Jack don't you know You don't tug on Superman's cape You don't spit into the wind You don't pull the mask off that old Lone Ranger And you don't mess around with Jim Well a hush fell over the pool room Jimmy come boppin' in off the street And when the cuttin' was done The only part that wasn't bloody Was the soles of the big man's feet, ooh And he was cut in about a hundred places And he was shot in a couple more And you better believe They sung another kind of story When big Jim hit the floor Now they say You don't tug on Superman's cape You don't spit into the wind You don't pull the mask off that old Lone Ranger And you don't mess around with Slim Yeah, big Jim got his hat Find out where it's at And it's not hustlin' people strange to you Even if you do got a two-piece custom-made pool cue Yeah you don't tug on Superman's cape You don't spit into the wind You don't pull the mask off the old Lone Ranger And you don't mess around with Slim. --------------------------------------------------------------------------</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Now this song may have served a dual purpose, the first being the chorus of "You don't mess around with Jim" fits so well with the scene because Hopper who is also named Jim feels like he's won a victory over Mike.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_244_895_3</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>So I started toying with ideas of refracting light off thier bodies to achieve invisibility, but wasn't to sure how that would work with thier magic mainly being used through thier minds.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_244_895_4</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>So then I started thinking about maybe it just being simply because they will themselves to not be visible to others, but that seemed to OP.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_244_895_5</DOCNO>

            	<TEXT>And i like the whole tricking thier senses so as they are not noticed or remembered, which could be seen as invisibility; and ties in well with the whole altering of the persons perception.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Also kinda still liking the idea of the user actually being able to make themselves invisible, but that's mainly because the magic system I'm working on being powered by the useres will, essentially thier desires so I guess in a way actually being invisible could work, but maybe only for those who have more mastery of the skill.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>The idea of warping reality itself actually really interested me, what I'm kinda going with now is that the source of this magic would be people's will, thier desires essentially they take hold of magic but generate the power from within themselves.</TEXT>
