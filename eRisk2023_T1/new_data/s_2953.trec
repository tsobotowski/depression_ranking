            	<TEXT>A few minutes later I get a call from my sisters phone and I answer it but its not my sister its Jared and he was soo pissed off and it was kind of scary because Ive always gotten along with Jared but he flipped out, he told me that I was trying to start drama and that those letters were from a long time ago and he didnt know my mom had kept them and it was an invasion of his privacy for me to read them, he told me that Id better throw them out and not tell my sister about it, that shes happy and shes finally recovering (my sister had a REALLY bad eating disorder up until recently, she was hospitalized a lot when she was a teenager) and gaining weight and telling her about this could stress her out and be triggering (its always a control thing when she feels like shes not in control she always just stops eating and becomes obsessive over how her body looks) and he said she cant be stressed out right now.</TEXT>
