            	<TEXT>The only thing I have against the Viz voice cast is that I can't unhear certain characters or other anime characters eg with Rei I can't unhear Marinette from MLB or Nanoha Takamachi, Kenji Tsukino as Gabriel Agreste from MLB or Johan Liebert Gurio Umino is voiced by Venom from Spectacular Spiderman, with Usagi I can't unhear Hinata Hyuga or Orihime InoueinBleach with Robbie Daymond(Tuxedo Mask)I can't unhear Spiderman from disk wars or Musai and Yukai from Naruto Sailor Mercury I can't unhear Sakura Haruno Sailor Jupiter I can't unhear Boruto Uzakami I could rant on and on about who I can't unhear, but the best part of Viz is that they're voiced by veteran anime actors we all know, but what about you, do you like the Viz voice cast?</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>To counteract some of your points 1) Batman became more broody because he probably felt like he wasn't making a difference, he also had a falling out with Dick Grayson because he was starting to get more brutal 2) The characters being fictional in Static Shock has been cut from reruns,all episodes and the DVD releases 3) The reason he gets his ass kicked alot in BTAS is because it's his show,if he went Batgod on everyone,then there'd be no show.</TEXT>
