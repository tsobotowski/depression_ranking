There doesn't appear to be anyone who offers Crohn's specific grants but there are many that do offer help for people on low incomes even if many have extraordinarily specific missions (such as helping only people with the surname Forsyth), there are many more like the [Talisman Trust](http://www.talismancharity.org/) and [Newby Trust](http://www.newby-trust.org.uk/) who do help people in poverty, illness, or low income circumsanaces.</TEXT>

Reducing Corporation tax is the least helpful mechanism of supporting UK trading businesses as exists, as demonstrated by the government - when they want to provide subsidy to an industry they almost always do it through VAT - for example the print media receives 1.2 billion a year in zero rated VAT, similarly oil exploration to the tune of 400 million a year.</TEXT>

Clacton wise Carswell had 53.0% of the vote in 2010, 59% in 2014, and *fell* to 44.5% in 2015 - still a massive result, but it has a great deal more to do with Carswell being a trusted MP than it does UKIP policy, given that UKIP had no national manifesto at the time.</TEXT>

The problem is the way rights are negotiated both historically and currently with national level broadcasters by region on ten year contracts - this type of licensing runs across many sports and is in general 'the way things are done' in the industry.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1338_806_3</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

If you wanted a centralized streaming solution then FOM would have to come to an agreement with *every* regional broadcaster over a licensing fee on the pictures (because they've already licenced them from FOM), and another separate agreement over the commentary (the IP for which is their property of the broadcaster), and a third over how and when the revenue is distributed.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1338_806_4</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

You could negotiate for FOM to hold the streaming rights exclusively, but FOM then wouldn't fetch a good price on the rights, and it would lower the quality of the TV shows because, as a business, the broadcaster will have to start to question the value of shipping a team of 30+ people around the world to every race in order to produce a show that it realises little or no cash flow from.</TEXT>

Achieving a global streaming deal would be a hugely complex effort and take years of negotiations - not only that but a centralised solution isn't necessarily in the financial interests of FOM or the regional broadcasters both of whom are buying the rights to a product they can repackage and sell at a profit.</TEXT>

$1 a race is completely unrealistic pricing wise though, it wouldn't even cover the production costs of filming the races let alone provide enough revenue for everyone to make money - remember the TV rights make up about $6 - 700 million of the team's prize money - hurting the value of the TV rights directly hurts the teams.</TEXT>

There are some things that the regs can balance driver weight wise, but its very hard to regulate for driver height not least because you have to alter the car to get the seating position right.</TEXT>

The issues that proposal was trying to solve were three fold:-

- That the WDC winner should also have won the most races;

- That the mid-grid teams are struggling financially and more points means more money delivered from FOM; and

- That all but the top three ceasing development late in the season made the racing dull and more points available would incentivise continued development while spicing up the drivers championship.</TEXT>

Merc paid for Force India's testing so Pascal Wehrlein would be in a position to meet the new superlicence regulations, they were trying to snag [Verstappen](http://www.jamesallenonf1.com/2014/09/mercedes-pushes-young-driver-programme-pascal-wehrlein-new-f1-reserve-driver/) and Ocon in 2014, and I can't see why they would do that without having seats to put them in (RBR kept VER by bumping him up to TR).</TEXT>

Also a Lotus buyout by Renault, [which seems likely](http://www.grandprix247.com/2015/05/28/have-renault-already-bought-lotus/), would leave them room for manuvre in the existing rules, they also compete in DTM with ART GrandPrix.</TEXT>

Hamilton was part of the decision making process, as he confirmed after the race, telling the team that the soft tyres were losing temperature and pressure behind the safety car and *if there was sufficient gap to easily pit and rejoin on new, warm supersofts for the final 12 laps, it would make sense.*</TEXT>

Some of my favorite moments are [Mansell carrying Senna](http://www.f1fanatic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/1991_mans_asenn_silv.jpg) over the finish line in the 1991 British Grand Prix, [Hakkien overtaking Schui at Spa in 2000](http://youtu.be/-eE3gCy5zvM) and Lauda's title deciding 11th to 2nd comeback drive at [Estoril in 1984](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_Portuguese_Grand_Prix)

What are your favorite memories of seasons past?</TEXT>
