* The need for a reasonably well paying job (because Sydney is an expensive place to live, and a lot of homeless people have lower levels of education)
* Access to [affordable housing](http://www.ahuri.edu.au/themes/homelessness1) to enable you to work and have a life
* [Lack of a personal social support network (family and friends)](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2729873/)

Another place which is nice is the [Chinese Gardens](http://www.easyweddings.com.au/locations/chinese-garden-of-friendship/) in Darling Harbour, but there is a lot of construction happening over that way at the moment :(

**Tax - Medicare Levy Surcharge** (relates to hospital cover)

**Lifetime Health Cover Loading** (relates to hospital cover)

You could also look into Red Cross who are front line too:
http://www.redcross.org/news/article/Red-Cross-Opens-New-Clinic-to-Fight-Ebola-in-Sierra-Leone
I'm not sure where to go to donate to Ebola from the US site, but the Australian site has a direct donation page to the Ebola outbreak appeal:
http://www.redcross.org.au/ebola-outbreak-2014-appeal.aspx


And another is Samaritans Purse whose staff were among the first to contract Ebola, so they are front line too:
http://www.samaritanspurse.org/

[This](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_markets_in_Sydney) is not a bad list but the best for tourists (near the city) are probably Paddy's Markets near Central Station, The Rocks market, Manly Arts   Crafts and Paddington Markets.</TEXT>

Off topic slightly, but related to income... Check out this page about LAFHA (Living Away From Home Allowance) - it could be useful:

There's been some changes in this year's budget in relation to it, due to people abusing the system, but I think (depending on the sort of visa you get) you can still get it.</TEXT>

* Max Brenners near Wynyard station
* GPO cafe (not sure of the name) - There's 2 inside
* La Guillotine behind Town Hall (actually a restaurant)
* Lime Cafe
* Boy Charlton Poolside Cafe (http://www.poolsidecafe.com.au/cafe/home/) - good on a nice day

http://www.phnompenhpost.com/index.php/2010021632077/National-news/acid-attacks-could-earn-life-in-prison.html
 AUTHORITIES will explore legislating stiff new punishments for perpetrators of acid crimes as part of measures aimed at quelling an apparent jump in reported incidents of the violent attacks, officials said Monday.</TEXT>

C) We don't have many of those self-flushing toilets in Australia, but I didn't like them when I was in the US because I kept trying to do a poo and while I am a novice at self flushing toilets, the sensor kept thinking I wasn't there and flushing while I was pooing, splashing my bum which was gross.</TEXT>

On a related note, I think that when you make a statement about your taste in art you can acceptably say 'I prefer this artist over the other artist' but you cannot definitively say that 'This artist is better than the other artist' because you are in a way suggesting that everyone feels the same way.</TEXT>

I gathered this:

Small towns: 10%

NYC: 20%

And then is it 5% either side of that if you liked or didn't like the service?</TEXT>

I still catch public transport only because

* It's still slightly cheaper than driving

* The train can be faster than driving in peak hour

I sometimes stay near work and just walk to work, but it is 4km over fairly hilly terrain and can be a little tiring after a long work day, and not that safe.</TEXT>
