The Observer has learned that EU diplomats agreed their uncompromising position at a crunch meeting on Tuesday, held to set out the unions strategy in the talks due to start next month 

And, this tidbit goes past even my capacity to overestimate the incompetence of the Tory/Brexit negotiators and their mad rush to activate Article 50:

Meanwhile, it has emerged that Britain failed to secure the backing of any of the 27 countries for its case that trade talks should start early in the two years of negotiations allowed by article 50 of the Lisbon treaty.</TEXT>

Despite a recent whistlestop tour of EU capitals by the Brexit secretary, David Davis, diplomats concluded unanimously that the European commission was right to block any talks about a future comprehensive trade deal until the UK agrees to settle its divorce bill  which some estimate could be as high as 60bn  and comes to a settlement on the rights of EU citizens.</TEXT>

[How many rooted Android devices are there?](https://www.quora.com/How-many-rooted-Android-devices-are-there): 

A study would need to be commissioned for anything near usefully accurate numbers, but if you use the official statistics of devices that have opted to report using the popular and widely available Cyanogenmod family of ROMs and then pad that with non-reporting devices and the multitude of other ROMs available, perhaps "over one million" isn't out of the realm of possibility?</TEXT>

The recent law allowing ISPs to spy on all their customers if it makes them even more money has turned your ISP to a big part of everyone's threat model: if they're collecting and tracking your every activity online so their execs can buy that third vacation home, it means someone else can use it too (hackers, plaintiffs, authorities, other nations' authorities)

Largely, a reliable VPN is your best defense against this threat.</TEXT>

[Lobbyist Overlord] Howard Waltzman, replied, Id turn the question around a little bit: Today the norm for the entire rest of the internet ecosystem is that edge providers, advertisers are able to share non-sensitive information on an opt-out basis The question is, why would you have different rules for ISPs in that regard?</TEXT>

This response was akin to those provided by Sims and the NCTA, eager to point out that edge providers  content companies, in regulatory speak  like Facebook are already selling your information to advertisers, so why cant your ISP, too?</TEXT>

But to Assange's credit, this time Wikileaks is approaching the companies privately instead publishing them publicly:

Yeah, just take a quick read through the comment history of this assclown /u/(another redditor here) and you'll find nothing but hate, spite and racist generalizations against whites and his obsession with a perceived 'caste system' in the U.S.

This guy would have been banned weeks ago for these racist rants if they targeted any other race, but he has become emboldened and more angry at the lack of any repercussions... now imagine how many more like him are out there?</TEXT>
