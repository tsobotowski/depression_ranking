The selection process is pretty complicated:

 The American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME) is a 15-question 3-hour test given since 1983 to those who rank in the top 5% (or score at least 100) on the AMC 12 high school mathematics contest (formerly known as the AHSME), and starting in 2010, those who rank in the top 2.5% (or score at least 120) on the AMC 10.</TEXT>

 For most vertebrate taxa (possibly excepting naked mole rats), the patterns expected under the social brain hypothesis are relatively straightforward: group members will face an increase in socially imposed cognitive challenges as social complexity increases; this should be matched by a similar pattern of increased brain investment.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> There's a great article in Quanta Magazine about recent research in bird evolution: https://www.quantamagazine.org/20150602-dinosaurs-to-birds/

An excerpt: 
 A bird didnt just evolve from a T. rex overnight, but rather the classic features of birds evolved one by one; first bipedal locomotion, then feathers, then a wishbone, then more complex feathers that look like quill-pen feathers, then wings, Brusatte said.</TEXT>

Because it is clear that the OP has some serious fundamental misconceptions about evolutionary theory, and your answer to their question was not even to explain kin selection in the context of homosexuality, but explain how it applies in a completely different context, and somehow expect the OP to draw a proper inference from the analogy, without the proper conceptual framework (i.e. kin selection) in which to properly map from one situation (eusocial insects and reproductive skew) to the other (human homosexuality).</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> To add a little to my own answer, there are a few other reasons of historical contingency which at least made our lineage more likely to evolve towards such high intelligence; we're primates, which have a fairly high brain to body size ratio among mammals already, most of whom are social and arboreal (both behaviors requiring bigger brains), who are already good at manipulating the environment (we have pretty awesome forearms), and who felt the pressure of climate change in African savannah around 5-7 million years ago which pushed us towards bipedalism and endurance running, and we are one of but many evolutionary trials of hominid species, ranging from robust primarily plant eating species to gracile omnivores, and we happen to be the ones that survived, despite at some point numbering less than a 100k.</TEXT>

if it were rooted in social behavior then you are forced to try to explain why music extends quite deeply into the realm of solitary behavior as well:

What I said was that music is an evolutionary trait related to us being social organisms.</TEXT>

http://insidetv.ew.com/2014/12/29/game-of-thrones-most-pirated-show/

Methods: I looked through KickAT, using the search term "Korra", looking through the first 4 pages of results ordered by seeds (by then, the number of seeds had dropped from over 2000 to about 200), and summed the number of episode torrents for Book 4 and Book 3 separately.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_2042_1033_3</DOCNO>

Results: Book 4 had at least 1.8m episode torrents.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_2042_1033_4</DOCNO>

        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_2042_1033_5</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Assuming I only looked at about 80% of all the downloads (a conservatively high number), I estimate at least 2.2m torrents for Book 4, and 560k torrents for Book 3.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_2042_1033_6</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Discussion: My guess is that my Book 3 estimate is actually much too low, since more time has passed since Book 3, and seed number has decayed, it's probably at least 1m if not more, as I can believe it being lower than Book 4 but not by such a huge amount (though being on tv for most of its run probably reduced torrents).</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_2042_1033_8</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Regardless, it is very possible that Korra has been torrented more in 2014 than 10th place South Park, though a proper comparison would require applying the above method to those shows as well, and seeing how well the numbers recovered match those given in the article (since I can't reproduce the article's methodology itself).</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_2042_1033_9</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Though it is somewhat an unfair comparison since Book 4 alone had 30% more episodes than South Park, and Book 3 and 4 together had 26 episodes all together, which is many more than most shows air in a year.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_2042_1033_10</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Nonetheless, my guess is that Korra episodes have been torrented at least 3 million times in the past 6 months since Book 3 aired, which should make it one of the 10 most popular episodes in terms of illegal downloads of 2014, possibly higher than Suits, Vikings, Grey's Anatomy, and Arrow.</TEXT>

tl;dr Korra was torrented at least 3 million times by a conservative episode between Books 3 and 4, which likely means it was one of the top 10 most torrented shows in 2014.</TEXT>
