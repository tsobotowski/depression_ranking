I would rank them (using shorthand for the movie titles):

**1) Die Hard 1**

**2) Die Hard 3**

**3) Die Hard 4**

**4) Die Hard 2**

**5) Die Hard 5**

I honestly don't get a lot of the hate I see for Die Hard 4, it was a clear winner over the second one and in my opinion it's close behind Die Hard 3.</TEXT>

The feats were the interesting additions, ~~the two feats (humans ftw :D)~~ I decided on going for Great Weapon Mastery ~~and Heavy Armor Mastery~~. The option for bonus 10 dmg to a swing in conjunction with a -5 to hit was very helpful for the bigger targets (I would wait till I had advantage before opting to use this skill) and the bonus attack if I bring a target below 0 HP (or if I crit) was especially awesome as there were several occasions where I was able to cleave down 2-3 adds in a single turn with good rolling :D (Just letting you know that we know the rule about 1 bonus action per turn, but my DM has allowed me to continue the ability with negs to hit, he likes the idea of cleaving lol)

~~Since I appeared to be the only *tank* my decision to go heavy armor mastery was a good one, that flat -3 physical damage really pays for itself and allows for more risky positioning (engaging 2 targets at once so I can cleave) not to mention the bonus str stat.~~

Overall I'm having a ball with the character and I've made a cool little backstory to him which I've asked to be fed into the story for a future plot point :D
