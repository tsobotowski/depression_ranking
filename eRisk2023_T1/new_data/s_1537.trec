Edit: Since people are asking about financials, here's the breakdown:

If I attend MSU, my mom and dad pay $10,000 EACH (so $20,000), I cover $10,000 with the work study I have been offered, and I have a merit scholarship for ($10,000)a scholarship for out of state ($7,000 and a scholarship for having studied abroad ($2,000) 

If I attend chapel hill, my dad will pay $25,000 full.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> I met Ian Watkins at a lostprophets M G. He was super creepy, and kept trying to lure me away from my mom (I was 14 at the time, so she wouldn't let me go alone)

It was really making me uncomfortable so I left to talk to the other members, and he called me a "slut" to my face :( 

Needless to say, I still love their music but I'm glad that asshat is in jail.</TEXT>
