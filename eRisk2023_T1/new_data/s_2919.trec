* Episode III - Venators fight some of the CIS ships, but the SDs are just backdrops
* Episode IV - the most a SD ever does is catch up to Tantive IV
* Episode V - the SDs at Hoth let everyone escape, and they get ion cannon'd... the Millennium Falcon just hangs out behind one and escapes
* Episode VI - Palpy just wants them to hang out at Endor for "the trap"
* Episode VII - dead on Jakku

I hope we see them actually do stuff in Rogue One.</TEXT>
