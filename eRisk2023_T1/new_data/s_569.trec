        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_569_357_17</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>It turns out, the raw data set you can pull from here is *awful*.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_569_357_18</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>It's literally all of the data, for all the KPIs, for every single country in the world, in a single giant spreadsheet with more than 70,000 rows.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_569_357_19</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>So I binned that and literally went through day-by-day on the website and manually wrote in each day's figures since January 10th, because I am mental.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_569_357_20</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>PHE data tells us that PCR-positive cases among 70+ year olds given a first dose of either vaccine have reduced by 60%; hospital admissions by 80%, and deaths by 85%.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_569_357_21</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>A new study whose pre-print was published yesterday, using ONS Infection Survey data, tells us that a first dose of either vaccine appears to reduce infections (symptomatic and asymptomatic) by 60% past the three-week mark, with the second dose increasing this to 70%.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>So, I figured, I can use the ONS and PHE data, along with the day-to-day cumulative first- and second-dose vaccination rates, to very crudely estimate what the day-to-day rolling averages of cases, hospital admissions and deaths would be without vaccination.</TEXT>
