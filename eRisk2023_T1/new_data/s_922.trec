            	<TEXT>Hey guys, just recently got an Orange PPC212 2x12 cab rated at 16 ohms and am thinking about picking up a Fender Super Champ X2 head rated at 8 ohms, I've read here and there that tube heads act differently than solid state when the impedance doesn't match so my question is will it hurt to use an 8 ohm tube head with a 16 ohm cab?</TEXT>
