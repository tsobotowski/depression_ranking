            	<TEXT>Well its hard to say if you are talking specifically about the 7 kingdoms together because I imagine that in the end the north will be its own separate kingdom and if that is the ending then I would say the starks will once again become a royal dynasty and carry on rule of the north for many centuries to come which is what it takes to be considered a dynasty lol like you cant say the targaryens/blackfyres considering young griff will most likely die and Dany as well and I do see Jon going back to the north somehow wether it be the wall or a lord/kings guard or something because he is more a stark then a Targaryen since he was raised by them.</TEXT>
