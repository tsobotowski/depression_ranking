EDIT: Adding more helpful advice - from what you've told us, I think you'd be better off looking for one of the following:

* A cheap Judo club

* A boxing gym

* A cheap wrestling club

* A serious muay thai gym

You're generally going to get more mileage out of a place that only does one thing because they typically have more and more consistent classes.</TEXT>

I won't get into a style vs. style argument because I don't believe in that, but my honest advice to you as my BJJ bro is to retire the Old School and instead learn some moves that let you use your hips more efficiently and involve fighting up to your base, like the Twist Sweep, or getting up to the Dogfight.</TEXT>

Similarly, I always try to finish the arm triangle with one arm and it works amazingly well, but if time is running out in a tournament, you better believe I'll do the old-school arm-triangle finish: lock my arms RNC-style, go to knee ride, and just try to neck crank them for the finish (it works).</TEXT>

So, I agree you should definitely try to finish these with the brace method and bodyweight only, especially in training, because in tournaments with time running out you can always "add back" the strength/squeeze to complement your technique instead of using strength **instead** of technique.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>

The other scenario in which the "hand across" works well is if you're more squared up with them, more like arm-triangle style, but have an ezekiel grip (this happens if they turn back toward you while you have the ezekiel grip).</TEXT>

**So bottom line TL;DR**: I always try Ryan's brace method first, because it can be more efficient sometimes (allowing me to use my body weight to tighten up the noose by leaning North.)</TEXT>

Ryan Hall would call it "lower body back control" (which I agree might not be better than 'the truck')

            	<TEXT>So on to the idea...

Let's say I have a huge list of URLs I have collected over several years (spoiler: I do have this, and it is genuinely huge.</TEXT>
        </DOC>

            	<DOCNO>s_2694_222_5</DOCNO>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_2694_222_7</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Let's further say that, *as an end product* I'd like to have these automatically clustered into categories by topic.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_2694_222_8</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>E.g., some of these links might point to machine learning articles, while others point to Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu techniques.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_2694_222_9</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

A manual sort would involve re-opening each article, then taking a stab at categorizing them into topics (e.g., BJJ and Machine Learning).</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_2694_222_10</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

To my untrained mind, the **automated** process would look something like this:

1) Plug all of the URLs into a program that automatically crawls each of them and scrapes all of (or a random sample of) the words. (</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_2694_222_11</DOCNO>

            	<DOCNO>s_2694_222_12</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

2) That program spits out data on each link that can be plugged into yet another program - like an agglomerative clustering algorithm - that automatically clusters them into categories.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_2694_222_13</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>E.g., the algorithm would be trained to recognize that articles talking about "double-leg takedowns" and "armbars" should be in the same cluster (jiu-jitsu) while articles talking about "neuroscience" and "bioinformatics" should be in another separate cluster.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_2694_222_14</DOCNO>

For me I point it out when I myself have accidentally reaped their knee, and to be extra fair I give my opponent the chance to reset if they want (they never do, because most agree it's a lame rule)

On a white belt I might point it out if they reap my knee because we have many active IBJJF competitors and it takes a while to develop that sensitivity/recognition, but I always preface that by saying it's a lame rule and not relevant in all formats.</TEXT>

However, I find that I much more often come up on a Crackdown-style position (for the wrestlers out there) meaning that unlike Ryan's over/under pass, I do not have control of their far hip, only their near leg.</TEXT>

My other mistake was not being able to stomp my foot in the crook of his far arm to trap it and use it as a lever to sit myself up away from the stack, which I'm normally able to do.</TEXT>

Having lost the pant grip and far arm trap, I transitioned (correctly I think) to controlling his near arm instead, but I should have realized that if I wasn't finishing the choke from here, controlling the near arm wouldnt help because he wasn't trying to spin "the right way" away correctly anyway.</TEXT>

So from here, he is out of the bow and arrow, so when I am getting rolled up and stacked, I will either transition to an armbar or take my top knee and kick him in the back with it, which spins me from the perpendicular bow and arrow threat back to a more traditional parallel back mount, where I can start again.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>For example, due to the stack I have lately had issues finishing the straight armbar from guard, the triangle, and sometimes even the bow and arrow.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_2694_415_7</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

I give those examples because they all require me to cut an angle in the same way, which is supposed to prevent the stack, but lately has not been working for me on more skilled opponents.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_2694_415_8</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Here's what I know I should be doing:

-Shoulder and head walking back to extend my spine

-Popping my hips into extension to make my legs heavy and prevent the crunch

-Framing with my hands to keep his weight off

-Cutting an angle to one side or another to disrupt his base

Context-specific examples: 

-For the bow and arrow and belly-up straight armbar I always control the near leg to theoretically prevent him from getting back to his knees, but doesnt always work for me

-For the triangle, I underhook his free arm or near leg to cut an angle which theoretically should prevent the stack, but doesnt always work for me

TL;DR: What do you do to prevent the stack?</TEXT>

The idea, though, is that by holding his sleeve, and putting all your weight into it through the sprawl, you open up the space he would normally have defended by keeping his elbow jammed in his hip crease or flush to his side.</TEXT>

But in my (completely subjective) opinion, I think this video showcases how the typical 10thP setups that involve entangling your legs actually end up locking down your own hips in a way that's really easy for a top-level black belt with good fundamentals (base, posture, pressure) to smash right through.</TEXT>

When getting their arm isolated for the omoplata, especially if you have an overhook, place your feet on their hips and use that leverage to pop your own hips up into their armpit as if you're bridging against them.</TEXT>

This will tend to put your whole thigh up over their back, making them carry your weight (destroying their posture) and preventing them from squaring up (keeping their arm isolated).</TEXT>

That way, when you actually go to finish you will have an easier time doing the stuff people have suggested in this thread (e.g., extending your legs and sitting up hard) because they never had a chance to build base and posture in the first place.</TEXT>
