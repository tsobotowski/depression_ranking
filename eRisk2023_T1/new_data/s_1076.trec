As for which book surprised me the most, man these are tough questions, I'd say Catch-22 because of the hype on here and it's non-linear narrative gave me doubts, The Stranger because I didn't know anything about it and it peeled my eyelids back, and Watership Down because I did not expect a story about rabbits to be so engrossing and so real.</TEXT>

My favorites so far from the list of 40, in no particular order: All Quiet on the Western Front, Perks of Being a Wallflower, Man's Search for Meaning, And Then There Were None, Sirens of Titan, and Any Human Heart

Currently, we skipped ahead and are reading East of Eden because many people have been trying to get me to read it and I gave into my own desire to do so.</TEXT>
