I can see a few legislation proposals:

* Tougher sentences for those who hack with malicious intent
* Sentences for those who support those who hack with malicious intent
* More security assurances required by holders of large amounts of customer information
* Fines for companies found to lack sufficient data security

All of which I would support.</TEXT>
