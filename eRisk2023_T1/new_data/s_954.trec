  Stanford faculty members call for fossil fuel divestment - full letter

As far as the threat that physicians would quit if we enacted an improved Medicare for all, first of all, very few would leave - likely less than 1 percent - and, second, since most of those who would leave seem to be more interested in money rather than patients (think concierge), we really dont want them around anyway.</TEXT>
