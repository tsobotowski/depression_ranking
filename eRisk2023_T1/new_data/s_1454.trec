N. has escaped his day of death, even as Set escaped his day of death... As the name of Set, in Ombos, endures, so may the name of N. endure..." - The Pyramid Texts With all this factored in, I feel it's reasonable to suggest we replace the western terms of LHP and RHP with Stellar and Solar respectively.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>I believe this because: - Nehushtan comes from the Uraeus Serpent of Egypt and Wadjet - Nehushtan comes from Ningishzida, the Mesopotamian serpent god of the Tree of Truth - Nehushtan was deeply tied to the worship of Asherah and Ba'al, and therefore Set as well - Nehushtan was tied to Chaoskampf heroes and heroines like Set/Ba'al and Asherah - Nehushtan was worshipped (not under that name) in other cultures such as Greek and Minoan culture - Nehushtan was the Rod of Asclepius and the Staff of Hermes (Hermes being the Greek version of Thoth and therefore of Ningishzida) - Nehushtan resembles divine beings that stood above and apart from Yahweh and used Egyptian magic, the Seraphim - Nehushtan was the Serpent of the Tree of Knowledge in Genesis, a type of serpentine divinity known as a "Seraphim" - The very etymology of Nehushtan's name implies it is a proper name not an adjective and ties it to Leviathan - History shows no reason or evidence Hezekiah desecrated Nehushtan's image - Hezekiah and other rulers of the time were close with Egypt and utilized winged Uraeus Serpents - Yahweh and his more dogmatic followers, like Hezekiah's son, are well known for twisting history and symbolism to suit Yahweh.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Nehushtan is the Uraeus Serpent, he is Ningishzida Lord of the Good Tree, the consort of Asherah (Set/Ba'al) who drives back Chaos, the Serpent who gave mankind the Apple, he who was worshipped in almost every culture, a divine, shining being that stood above even the throne of Yahweh and was so powerful that Christ tried to steal his roles and powers, and who eventually faced Yahweh's wrath. ............. **</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>I believe this because: - Nehushtan comes from the Uraeus Serpent of Egypt and Wadjet - Nehushtan comes from Ningishzida, the Mesopotamian serpent god of the Tree of Truth - Nehushtan was deeply tied to the worship of Asherah and Ba'al, and therefore Set as well - Nehushtan was tied to Chaoskampf heroes and heroines like Set/Ba'al and Asherah - Nehushtan was worshipped (not under that name) in other cultures such as Greek and Minoan culture - Nehushtan was the Rod of Asclepius and the Staff of Hermes (Hermes being the Greek version of Thoth and therefore of Ningishzida) - Nehushtan resembles divine beings that stood above and apart from Yahweh and used Egyptian magic, the Seraphim - Nehushtan was the Serpent of the Tree of Knowledge in Genesis, a type of serpentine divinity known as a "Seraphim" - The very etymology of Nehushtan's name implies it is a proper name not an adjective and ties it to Leviathan - History shows no reason or evidence Hezekiah desecrated Nehushtan's image - Hezekiah and other rulers of the time were close with Egypt and utilized winged Uraeus Serpents - Yahweh and his more dogmatic followers, like Hezekiah's son, are well known for twisting history and symbolism to suit Yahweh.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>That said, I believe Nehushtan is the proper name of the Serpent from Eden, and was its own distinct, powerful deity worshipped throughout much of history in the area.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1454_177_102</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>I believe this because: - Nehushtan comes from the Uraeus Serpent of Egypt and Wadjet - Nehushtan comes from Ningishzida, the Mesopotamian serpent god of the Tree of Truth - Nehushtan was deeply tied to the worship of Asherah and Ba'al, and therefore Set as well - Nehushtan was tied to Chaoskampf heroes and heroines like Set/Ba'al and Asherah - Nehushtan was worshipped (not under that name) in other cultures such as Greek and Minoan culture - Nehushtan was the Rod of Asclepius and the Staff of Hermes (Hermes being the Greek version of Thoth and therefore of Ningishzida) - Nehushtan resembles divine beings that stood above and apart from Yahweh and used Egyptian magic, the Seraphim - Nehushtan was the Serpent of the Tree of Knowledge in Genesis, a type of serpentine divinity known as a "Seraphim" - The very etymology of Nehushtan's name implies it is a proper name not an adjective and ties it to Leviathan - History shows no reason or evidence Hezekiah desecrated Nehushtan's image - Hezekiah and other rulers of the time were close with Egypt and utilized winged Uraeus Serpents - Yahweh and his more dogmatic followers, like Hezekiah's son, are well known for twisting history and symbolism to suit Yahweh.</TEXT>
