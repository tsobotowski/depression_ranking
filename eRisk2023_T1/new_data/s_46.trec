Funny thing is that because of some local law new mayor is chosen by a single person that is assigned to that position ( this person is appointed and can't be replaced unless mayor chooses to do so ) ... Oddly enough same person has been assigning all these crooked mayors since, you guessed it, early 80s :) 

We have mayoral election coming up and as of right now only relevant candidate is the guy that was assigned to that position.</TEXT>

For example one of the largest concentration camps in Europe was Jasenovac in Croatia and was operated by Ustae ( Croatian Nationalistic Army that was fighting on the side on Nazis ) majority of people in concentration camps operated by Ustae were in fact Serbs, Gypsies, Bosnians, Albanians, etc ... 

There is no denying that for the most part Jews were main target of Nazis, but to say that they were only people that suffered in concentration camps is historically inaccurate and even offensive for those of us who had ancestors that shared the same fate as Jews.</TEXT>

Official response form Sony is that it prevents overheating issue, but that is not entirely true, because A6500 for example will crap out in 4k ether way if you keep it running on room temperature ( 72F in my case ) 

Additionally if you do own or are planing to purchase A6500 get screen protector immediately!</TEXT>

Problem is that some clients simply " disappear " form the face of the earth and year or two goes by before they " reappear " to pay the balance and pick up the video, albums, etc ... 

**Edit:** I see that my question caused some confusion, so here is the detailed breakdown of how we charge.</TEXT>

Deposit ( Usually $500 )

Remaining balance is due at the day of the wedding ( only if they are not ordering wedding albums )

If their package does include wedding albums than we charge 70% of remaining balance at the day of the wedding and remaining 30% after 6 month or when they pickup the albums and video ( whichever comes first ) 

Now, problem is that recently few clients with albums in their packages who are avoiding/stalling final payment and delivery.</TEXT>

Take a look at what I pay every 6 month for insurance: 

Total insurance coverage Cost for six months: $715.00 

Bodily Injury Liability: $156.00

Uninsured/Underinsured Motorist Bodily Injury: $33.00

Personal Injury Protection - Medical Expense: $230.00

Extended Medical Payments: $1.00

Total for medical expenses is: $420.00 for 6 month period or 59% of my total policy cost goes toward medical insurance!!!</TEXT>

Now multiply these numbers with the number of public and private vehicles insured and that number would skyrocket in to billions of extra dollars that we as a society could use to improve education, employment, work environment, infrastructure, standard of living ... 

That is just one of the reasons I laugh when I hear the argument " Yes, universal health coverage is a great idea, but overall it will cost taxpayers more money "
