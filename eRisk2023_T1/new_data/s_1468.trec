I don't know how many matches until he proved his worth because I don't watch Juve that often but as someone who goes to about 80% of our youth and reserve games (at home) I can tell you Pogba didn't deserve to be getting games for the first team.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>We couldn't give in to him otherwise every youth player would do it like is happening now with us and pereira who once again is playing for the reserves and feels he deserves to play for the first team and won't sign a new contract but he doesn't deserve to be in the first team as he is playing quite average himself but no doubt if he leaves and starts playing well then it will be the usual "oh United made a huge mistake"

You argue obviously he was ready but with Juve he is in a midfield 3 where as with us he was in a 2 so maybe that's why he couldn't shine with us, maybe that's why he was able to look so good for you because he plays in a formation we never would have usually under fergie

He wanted a chance that's true but he can't just say he wants a chance and then continue to be bang average playing against people that were inferior to him, he should have been tearing people apart to prove he was ready

Also don't know who's down voting you and don't really no why, you're just putting your opinion across</TEXT>
