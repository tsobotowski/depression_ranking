            	<TEXT>On console it had no competition purely because... They had no recoil (while other HCs were barely controllable) Almost perfect in-air accuracy (while other HCs barely had any) No bloom (which currently make all 140s and 150s extremely inconsistent) Fastest TTK of all HCs (while you needed to time your shots with other HCs to get the three tap which in turn slows down the TTK) All of this (and more) creates a situation where the best players get the easiest gun to use while those who couldnt get LH/NF have to suffer with weapons that are worse in almost every aspect, this lead to the awful pulse rifle meta on console because pulse rifles are in an amazing spot.</TEXT>

I don't even want to go there, currently they have the most tanking capabilities like spinning and dodging with damage resistance making them almost impossible headshot snipe and the reach, holy Jesus, I've been killed by a swipe when I was three metres above the guy diagonally) and as for other Titan supers, they're pretty good (burning maul is a great shutdown and has excellent tracking but lacks in maneuverability which makes it hard to dodge things at range, even the little twirl feels clunky but I'm fine with that, firstly because IT'S A GIANT HAMMER, and secondly because it's fine if something has a weakness which opens up a window for outplayability [is this even a word]).</TEXT>

I do this all of the in crucible but what's more interesting is the you can give your teammates the Armor of light buff as well as defensive strike, so I bubbled a boss, got a melee kill and my two hunter friends using the arc melee combo with one-two punch went in my bubble and destroyed a boss.</TEXT>
