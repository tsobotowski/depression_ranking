            	<TEXT>The only other possible option i see would be to cull the males when they show sex, and then once harvest is over on the females to 24 hour em again to re-veg the same plants and keep them going that way, i know this is also less than ideal.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>However a good friend of mine is a engineer, and when i explained the process he thought the bag could possibly help, as he seemed to think it would hold the buds together containing them better between the plates, allowing more pressure from the plates to squeeze out the oils more effectively increasing yields, or he said the bags could blow out and it would be a total waste of time.</TEXT>
