Off the top of my head: 

* JK Rowling writes fantasy and mysteries (latter under pen name)

* John Banville writes lit fiction and mysteries (latter under pen name)

* Stephen King has had success in a ton of genres

* Lots of literary fiction writers have "genre" books that did well.</TEXT>

Sure, traditional publishing takes a bigger percentage but they also
* Pay an advance upfront
* pay to have the book printed
* Pay for editing, copyediting, proofing, and design
* and (hopefully) pay for some kind of marketing

In addition, they have distribution that gets you into bookstores

Amazon takes a much lower cut, but also does nothing at all for your book other than transfer digital files for essentially zero cents and provide a platform where your book exists alongside 10 million others.</TEXT>

* Dany
* Jon Snow
* Bran
* Tyrion

Others I really don't think will die before then

* Euron (think he will be big baddy along with White Walkers) 
* Sansa (think she survives whole series, though she is certainly "killable" if Martin wanted)
* Arya

Character I hope lasts till near the end: 

* Stannis</TEXT>

This year Vox Day, an openly racist and sexist (talks about blacks as subhuman, advocates assaulting women) guy ran a "rabid puppy" slate full of 

A) openly racist or extreme right wingers

B) himself and his friends

(A and B completely overlap of course)

It was actually Vox Day's  slate that dominated the Hugo's not the Sad Puppy one.</TEXT>

 while the big consumer world is at the theater gobbling up the latest Avengers movie, fandom is giving science fictions most prestigious award to stories and books that bore the crap out of the people at the theate

 Ill say it again: the Hugos (and the Nebulas too) have lost cachet, because at the same time SF/F has exploded popularly  with larger-than-life, exciting, entertaining franchises and products  the voting body of fandom have tended to go in the opposite direction: *niche*, academic, overtly to the Left in ideology and flavor, and ultimately lacking what might best be called visceral, gut-level, swashbuckling fun.</TEXT>

But Martin could easily just wrote an epilogue set in the future showing some king lasts a long time, or simply tell us that happens in the last paragraph (or, more likely, sets up the ending to have the major baddies and "players" we know of killed so that we assume the new king will last)

Also, if you read The World of Ice and Fire, plenty of Targ kings lasted for decades.</TEXT>
