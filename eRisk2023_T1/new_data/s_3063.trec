            	<TEXT>UKIP are the only major party to do this and I'd really like to thank you personally for the work you've done in this area

 "Under the leadership of Jyrki Katainen, chairman from 2004 to 2014, the National Coalition Party shifted from a socially conservative, neoliberal party of the upper class towards a socially liberal, centre-right catch-all party.[8][9] It is now moderately liberal and reformist,[10] and supports, among other things, multiculturalism[11] and same sex marriage.[12"

            	<DOCNO>s_3063_1946_3</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

While it's true that some people alleged that a rape occurred (mainly the accuser herself), the crime she was facing trial for was for making false rape accusations The BBC is obliged to report matters impartially and neutrally, and it's obvious that the key alleged offence here is that of making false rape accusations as that's the only offence for which there's sufficient evidence for a prosecution.</TEXT>

I'm not sure if you're the one responsible for the ridiculously biased and offensive choice of headline but the article does carry your name, and due to the BBC's failure to be transparent and provide any other contact details for the material we at HEqual will have to assume your the one responsible for the content unless we hear otherwise.</TEXT>
