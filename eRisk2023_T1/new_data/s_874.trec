And this is not something Ukrainians made up, as several Slavic languages use the same:

Polish - kraj

Slovak - krajina

Belarusian - 


Some will even argue that Russia's calling Ukraine "the edge" is because Ukraine always meant "the country" where Ukraine now is (like the Chinese say "middle kingdom") and when some "Ukrainians" (countrymen) emigrated to Russia before it was Russia they referred to the "country" they left as "Ukraine", because that's wat it was.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>

Let's see how many time the author does this - calls out others' coverage of Appalachia - while avoiding any discussion of substance: 

1) 

The authors establish a region in Appalachia or the Rust Belt as ground zero for the archetypal Trump hillbilly voter while walking through what they see as paradoxes of our politics or lack thereof, before concluding with their wisdom on what should be done about us.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_874_567_2</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

2) 

Currently, the pundit class is waging a self-made war over appropriate emotional response to the anticipated suffering of Trump voters and individuals like me who share their communities.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_874_567_3</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

3)

What this genre looks like is pundits who are almost universally men and almost exclusively white, firing off sleazy ideas about hillbillies while doing a very poor job differentiating between Trump voters and the average sort of disadvantaged person who lives in Appalachia or the Rust Belt.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_874_567_4</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

4) 

Every generation of politicians, writers, analysts, academics and economists believes it has discovered something unique or horrible or paradoxical about Appalachia

5) 

liberal compulsion [is] to hold up the disadvantaged Appalachian or Rust Belter as a stand-in for all Trump voters while arguing above his head how much sympathy were allowed to have with him eliminates any productive exchange of resistance politics among progressives.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_874_567_6</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Furthermore, the article only very superficially delves into "the media elites obsession with the 'hillbilly problem' " and fails to address why this is wrong (I agree it likely is and wanted to know how/why) based on any "insider insights" which the author presumably could give (since the author "lives here").</TEXT>

Take this gem for example:

The odiousness of this genres popularity is that it **eliminates any productive discussion of actual problems** by centering the real issue its authors have with the region: namely, that a fraction of the people in this country with repressive political views who look too much like them for comfort live here.</TEXT>

https://np.reddit.com/r/UkrainianConflict/comments/60mz0y/manafort_and_yanukovych_laundered_money_through/

I posted this to /r/ukrainianconflict, it's in Russian, but here a couple of the paragraphs:

The author of this investigation managed to obtain documents which confirm payments from Yanukovych to Manafort using off-shore jurisdictions and banks of dubious reputation.</TEXT>

The documents themselves point to the payments to Manafort being entailing money laundering and scams using payments systems; this is a criminal offence in the United States.</TEXT>

They are followed by this:

So, I personally think Putin took Crimea knowing full well it comes with offshore oil and gas fields (and that makes him even righer, though to be fair I think they are not devleoping those fields now as it is a legal minefield - International law recognizes the fields as Ukraine's and any company trying to devleop them would be hit with sanctions) and also he did it to bolster his declining popularity in Russia itself.</TEXT>

So, say the user chooses "category A", "quiz me on value"

Then the module should choose 10 random nodes of type A and pose questions like

1.</TEXT>

Choose the correct value: 1 | 2 | 3 | 4

The user chooses the correct answer, say "2" and the next question comes up and so on until the end of the quiz, after which the score is shown.</TEXT>
