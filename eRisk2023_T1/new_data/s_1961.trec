I don't want to be too judgmental, but my warning bells are ringing... we INFP's are quite easily accessible for manipulative persons, that seem to be nice and caring, but you're just another marionette for them... since you said she's doing it in a subtle way and also to other people, she might have a narcissistic tendency..  

Hopefully, that distance you already created will help you to find emotional distance, so that you can think about it a bit clearer...

Just my two cents.. I hope it helped you a bit to find the right path.</TEXT>

Once I started thinking about this society with its values and morals, about people describing themselves with their job, about how everyone expects you to fit into this society, because otherwise you would not be a part of it, **that's** where I stopped trying to fit into something:

We are **not** just a sentence or just a part of a category, or simply our job.</TEXT>

Now sarcasm seems to be something where opinions tremendously differ on: 
For some, sarcasm is extremly hurtful and with always a bad intention, an expression of verbally sadistic, narcisstic people (now don't get me wrong, this is definitely not my opinion).</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1961_43_5</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>
For others, it's a way of communication, with which the sarcastic person is playing down his/her emotions verbally (to the outside), but still kind of hurt inside.</TEXT>
