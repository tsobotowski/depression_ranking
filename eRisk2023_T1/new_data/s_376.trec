You're not the first person to suggest bar owners shouldn't charge so fucking much for a drink, to be fair they're utterly the victims of their own demise, uni students etc just can't afford $15 for a 1.3 standard drink Smirnoff or whatever (and that was prequake prices..)

For the record, here's the table for the amount of money you get [for being being on the pension](http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/map/deskfile/nz-superannuation-and-veterans-pension-tables/new-zealand-superannuation-and-veterans-pension-ra.html)

We pay more to our old people than we do to a [single parent](http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/map/deskfile/main-benefits-rates/sole-parent-support-current.html)

[Or to people looking for a job.](http://www.workandincome.govt.nz/map/deskfile/main-benefits-rates/jobseeker-support-current.htm)

And if you do work until you're 65, even on a meagre salary you don't get any support at all.</TEXT>

So yes, it's absolutely ageist, we pay our old people regardless of..

* How much they've worked,
* How little they've worked, 
* Whether they're still working, 
* How much money they own or have in the bank, 
* What assets they have, 
* How many dependents they have..
* Whether they're in the country
*Or ANY of the prerequisites required of the younger generations.</TEXT>

They are as you point out following the "rules" but ironicaly I believe it's the current rules set by the media companies in regards to contracts and agreement prices for set television shows (to ensure they get the best price possible) that is actually working heavily against the on-sellers like Lightbox etc.</TEXT>

I get the uneasy feeling the media companies themselves I'm sure don't want to see a Spotify-like company crop up as that might be seen as devaluing their product (E.g. Television shows) however much they actually make.</TEXT>

You can't really argue against them (such is the profit driven Hollywood Corporations attitude) which makes acquiring the TV shows and charging a reasonable price almost impossible as I'm sure they place certain strict caveats against how much you can charge/how you can provide the content via DRM etc.</TEXT>

However having been just a mere fly on the wall viewing geographic paywalls slowly disintegrating for a few years now you have to wonder why their research didn't better understand the current market trends, and look at successful content providers such as Spotify or Netflix and working with/against the DRM restrictions to provide a middle ground that meet the demands of the consumers with the requirements of the corporations you're buying the product from.</TEXT>

From seeing it done a few times, depending on damage.. 
They would need to:

* Dig up X amount off road
* Lay new substrate
* Lay new tar seal and chip it

Or at least that's my extremely layman's point of view, but I'm sure you wouldn't get much change from a 80-100K $ per KM.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>And then you factor in redoing the bridge, this will be signifcantly higher due to probably needing to shut down the bridge/have a stop/go so probably nearer $300-400k per KM

Edit: he's recording for at least say 3minutes using this [distance calculator website cause I'm lazy..](http://www.machinehead-software.co.uk/bike/speed_distance_time_calc.html) and he's travelling at 90km/h for the entire trip, say 2minutes at 90km/h = 3kms.</TEXT>

It would good be for a police person to confirm, but I've seen most cars not get caught at 5-7km/h so I can only presume they're lowering the tolerance to only 4km/h and will be more vigilant in pulling you over/issuing a fine?</TEXT>

Etc.</TEXT>

This is all dependent upon local involvement, obviously someone needs to post these events, but as it's been out for a wee while now, and thanks to advertising drives it is getting more and more popular, so while there may not be much happening in your area it's worth sticking with it.</TEXT>

If your assessment is correct, and complacency and drivers revert to a 'comfortable' level of driving on our roads then I can't help but wonder how/if we can even approach this from an education standpoint, I guess the arrows on the road are a good step, but a quick test (as many propose) would quickly become a distant memory when passing the 15th dead possum on the road from Nelson to Twizel, rendering any skills learnt at arrival void as one slips back to their standard routine.</TEXT>

They have not adapted by upgrading the Internal's, as one commenter on here mentioned, his 2 year old M7 is still more than adequate due to the chipset, so upgrading the internals is not adapting, as this isn't a very marketable changed this only serves to illustrate my point they have failed to innovate by upgrading their chipset with the same externals!</TEXT>

How a layman sees it while looking at what phone to buy:

**Screen:**

* M7: 4.7 FHD

* M8: 4.7 FHD

* M9: 4.7 FHD

**Design:**

* M7: Aluminum unibody

* M8: Aluminum unibody

* M9: Aluminum unibody

**Operating system:**

* M7: Lollipop

* M8: Lollipop

* M9: Lollipop

**Speakers:**

* M7: Front Stereo

* M8: Front Stereo

* M9: Front Stereo

**Camera:** 

* M7: Takes photos

* M8: Takes photos

* M9: Takes photos

I've been horribly disappointed that basically the bloody camera defaults to an (obscenely low)1/33 for EVERY scenario and just alters to ISO to cope, except for extremely bright scenarios!</TEXT>

To back this claim up I've gone through my photos and summarized the settings the camera chose:

* In a well lit pool environment (Shutter 1/33 ISO250), 

* In a zoo on a sunny day (Shutter 1/33-1/110 ISO40-80), 

* At home with good natural light (Shutter: **1/17-1/20** ISO 320-100) 

* And out and about (Shutter **1/15** ISO400)

Even with an APS-C sensor D7000 with 50mm F2.2 fails to take decent photos at 1/17 hand held for goodness sake!</TEXT>

After having used the S4 *(which I usually didn't even bother to try and take quick photos on as it barely focus in anything other than perfect burn-your-retina bright sunlight)* for a year, I'm really disappointed in Samsung for doing very very little in the image stabilization department, I had hoped they would utilise the ISOCELL sensor to increase the shutter priority and allow for higher ISO's but this is simply not the case.</TEXT>

As you're educated on the subject I understand where you're coming from and it must be frustrating to read comments like mine, but let's be honest here, it's not likely to change as the media aren't going to change how they report things of this nature - e.g. "anticorruption measure" stories will get buried amongst stories about corrupt officials each and every time, so can you blame me?</TEXT>
