            	<DOCNO>s_3010_392_3</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>In the majority of cases, there is very little business logic in the Lambda function between API Gateway and DynamoDB.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Lambda function stores fields in DynamoDB and formulates the response to return via the gateway I come from a Spring Boot background where there would typically be a number of objects involved here - at minimum, a Request object, a database Entity, and a ModelMapper to convert between the two.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_3010_392_9</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>So my inclination is to define and use objects within the Lambda function; this does help me keep the code straight in my head, but sometimes it feels like overkill, and is rather error-prone (I'm not using any libraries for this in particular, so I might, for example, add a field to the Request object but forget to actually save it to DynamoDB).</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>And from what I've seen of Rick Houlihan's talks, it seems that he advocates keeping things simple: let the client do the heavy lifting of parsing items from DynamoDB, and don't use Entity objects because constructing them is a waste of CPU time.</TEXT>
