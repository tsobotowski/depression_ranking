Also, just from my own personal experience; the worst thing you can do when someone if upset and doesn't want to talk about it is keep asking them to talk about it and not let them get over it on their own if that's what they want to do because it just makes everyone feel worse.</TEXT>

sorry that got a bit dramatic at the end there but i think its still relevant :/ i think knowing you are doing the right thing and dealing with your own guilt issues is a far more manageable task than dealing with other people abusing and shaming you because of THEIR issues.</TEXT>

There can always be some overlap; not every cancer patient has a heart of gold and sometimes sick people are abusive too, but in general i think the key difference is that you might hate caring for a cancer patient or invalid but you at least know you are helping them even if they dont appreciate it.</TEXT>
