Just because the government can [cook statistics](http://www.shadowstats.com/alternate_data) to claim that unemployment is only ~5% (when including "discouraged workers" doubles it, and including long-term discouraged workers which Clinton redefined out of existence multiples the number by more than 4), and that the economy grew for this or that quarter thereby not making us in a recession any more, is statistical lunacy.</TEXT>
