I can't find the 24hr fridge claim but I'd be willing to bet money that the "fridge" they are talking about is some sort of 24v fridge sold into RVs and campers Also watch out as you are clearly paying a branding tax on that stuff at that site-- lots of companies like to grift and squeeze profit this way-- it looks like 4Patriots is simply white-labeling their logos on stuff designed and manufactured by others.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>I split time between boston and western maine and have learned some things: * Maine people are totally fine with clean energy * Maine people hate the CMP power company with the power of 10,000 suns * Maine people do not trust a single word CMP says * Maine people believe that anything CMP says is "good" is in fact bad for Maine Basically the vote was a giant "fuck-you" to CMP from the state -- they will never support anything CMP pushes because the company is such a giant dumpster fire that has alienated and pissed off people from every age group, demographic and political camp The actual question did not matter -- Mainers saw a chance to fuck with CMP to get some payback and they took it.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>It looks like you are putting in full explicit paths in your environment module settings instead of passing in directories -- PATH should point to a directory and so should PYTHONHOME More generic advice ... Some advice on environment modules (I have systems where we have 5 different python versions installed and 10+ versions of R ) * I'd encourage you to step away from the OS provided version of Python if you are going to go down this path.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>The OS versions of anything can be changed or altered via system patching and updates and that is not a good thing in HPC where you want to be as reproducible as possible * Environment modules is cleaner when your tool or app is installed into an upper level folder that has it's own "bin/" "lib/" "man/" subdirectories * Building from source code is the way to solve the above two issues -- (a) you get away from the OS version that can be altered at any time and (b) when you compile you can do stuff like "./configure --prefix=/opt/python/3.9.x/" and the end result is that your build will install into /opt/python/3.9.x/ and all your bin/ lib/ and other subfolders will be there which makes setting up the environment modules easier * Start planning now for having multiple pythons which means your modulesfile/ folder should not be set up as "python-3.9" but rather as a folder called python/ with a "3.9" file in it.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>The point of environment modules is to put your software AWAY from common locations like /usr/bin -- for instance /usr/bin is likely already in your $PATH so there is no need at all for environment modules at all because it's in your default path already so anyone typing "python3" or whatever is gonna be using what was installed in /usr/bin/ Basically environment modules is just a framework for messing with environment variables in ways that facilitate the usage of many apps (or many versions of the same apps) installed in nonstandard locations Imagine you unpack python-3.10.tgz source code into a temp build directory and then run the command "./configure --prefix=/opt/python/3.10/" followed by "make" and "make install" What would happen then is that the build script will compile python and install all of that new python under the /opt/python/3.10/ folder And inside that you would have: /opt/python/3.10/bin /opt/python/3.10/lib /opt/python/3.10/man .. and so on.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> So that means in environment modules for python/3.10 you'd do stuff like: setenv PYTHONHOME /opt/python/3.10 prepend-path PATH /opt/python/3.10/bin prepend-path LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH /opt/python/3.10/lib prepend-path MANPATH /opt/python/3.10/man The "trick" here is that your custom software has custom bin/ lib/ man/ and other folders inside the special location where you chose to install it.</TEXT>
