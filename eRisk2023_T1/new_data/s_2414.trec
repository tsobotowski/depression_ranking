When jews become apart of the larger culture theirs always a fear among jews that they will lose their respective heritage, religion etc that's why it's sometimes frowned upon by certain jewish communities but never outright hostility, most jews just prefer to marry other jews, i'm black, my mom prefers i would marry a black woman, my sister is now dating a white guy and she's cool with that too now, same concept really some people just like the idea of being able to relate to their childrens future spouse, having their grand children raised in the same culture/religion etc in i have no issue with that as long as you're cool with them coming back one day with someone completely different from your background and still loving them equally.</TEXT>

Of course not, if i torrent something it's because it's either not available or easy to acquire because trust me torrents are a bitch to download if you have no clue what you're doing, you need like 3 different programs(i won't ay them because of this subreddit probably has some random no torrent list rule) and at-least some basic common sense to figure out non malware torrents which cuts out  a large group of casual consumers who do not even know how to properly upload pics to things outside of fb.</TEXT>

using nothing more then sound these guys could hack long distance calls, which in the 70's/80's was a huge thing, it would be the equivalent of unlimited minutes/texting back in the early 2,000's without paying a goddamn cent.</TEXT>

That's how i learned that the palestenians aka arabs suffer because of their own stupidity, that's how i learned why israel is blockading gaza and why the world seems so content to allow the new "nazi's" aka israel do this in guess what it's not because the jews control congress (but it's cute that the entire pal narrative relies on blood libel to convince the always anti-semitic euro's to hate the jews even more) it's because israel is a secular democracy, it's because israel is the only country in a region full of arab nation's that provides more rights to Arabs then even arab countries provide to their own citizens in sometimes this is to the detriment of the jewish israeli's especially when one pal arab who got a free college degree while in prison for stabbing a jewish kid gets out in becomes a bomb maker for hamas or coordinates more "resistance" attacks by targeting kindergartens.</TEXT>

In you're perfectly fine and from my personal experience your outlook more common then uncommon at-least going by my ex's, allot of times people assume rape victims should be crying, tearful or feeling disgusted in some ways but whenever one of my ex's disclosed this information to me it was either delivered in a matter of fact way or nonchalantly or sometimes just a random w.e to start a conversation.</TEXT>

The only way masculinity as you believe can be toxic is if masculinity becomes a set ideal or benchmark, in while in the past in certain societies you would be correct, their was a definite ideal of what well defined masculinity entail but like time itself things change, what you consider toxic someone else considers the norm and what they consider the norm i find weird.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>While the idea of boob armor is literally retarded because it directs the blade towards your chest center which is a weak point ciri's armor in the first picture with a little adjustment could direct the blade away, just flatten out the main metal chest piece  so a blade hitting it would slide off remember blades are cutting tools, you can't pierce plate i doubt it would even cause any kind of internal bleeding unless he were to use a bludgeon type weapon or a sword hilt http://www.radpour.com/images/stories/sassanian_persian_archer.jpg

In false accusations should be punished extensively, you can't declare rape is a serious crime and then allow the false reporting of rape to continue, you're making a mockery of rape, you're basically saying rape is the worse crime a woman can endure but it's perfectly fine if another woman lies about rape and deliberately hurting how actual rapes will be treated in the future, has no one ever read a boy cried wolf, same concept applies.</TEXT>
