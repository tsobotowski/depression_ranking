            	<TEXT>Finally as long as you are attuned to the Tiara, you must make a charisma saving throw at the end of each day (DC 18) or take a permanent-2 to your max health, as the Tiara drains your own soul, if this reduces your maximum health to 0 hit points, you die and your soul becomes trapped in the Tiara, only a wish spell or something if similar power can free the soul, a greater restoration can restore hit points lost in this way.</TEXT>
