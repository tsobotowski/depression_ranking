            	<TEXT> Hey,

Recently I have ran out of space in the drive that I installed FL's 'Data' folder on, and I'm not too keen on deleting the other files I have in the same drive just to free up space when I have a second hard drive that has 2TB of free space.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1203_0_3</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>
So, I thought, I should just be able to drag and drop the 'Data' folder into the new drive and FL should still look for that folder on my computer and use it to load everything.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1203_0_4</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>But, I did that, and for whatever reason nothing showed up in my FL; all of my projects were gone, my samples, everything.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1203_0_5</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>I couldn't even load the default project.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1203_0_6</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>
I was wondering whether I'd have to change the destination that FL looks in for its data and tried copying everything back over to my secondary drive (I had previously copied it to here, then back to where I had installed, and it worked - everything came back up, but there was still no space) and realised that a) It was going to take an hour and 15 minutes, when copying before only took about a minute and b) There was still a 'Data' folder left over in my secondary drive which only had the 'Patches' subfolder in it.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1203_0_7</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

TL;DR - Copied 'Data' folder to new drive for more space, everything (projects, samples, etc) disappeared, copied back and it worked they returned, but would still like to move my Data folder to the new drive so I can continue to download packs and save projects there etc.</TEXT>

I just wanted to reach out to any furries up in the UK, specifically towards the North, since I've looked all over the internet and there are barely any meets or communities for us up here and it makes me sad... I need furry friends :(
If any of you are up North (or anywhere else in the UK, I'm not too bothered) I would love to chat to you and get to know one another because whilst this is such a lovely community I feel like were lurking in the shadows over here and we need to expand a little more! :)</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>I really really like the atmosphere of this community, but I'm not sure that's because it makes me feel like I belong with some relatively like minded people (furries generally share common interests from what I've seen, eg games, art, Internet culture etc) or because I'm actually interested in the rest of the fandom.</TEXT>

To clarify;

When you are playing in multiplayer, there are separate leagues (you can rename them or whatever if you like :D) and when you enter that league, you play against other players also in that league, so everyone's on the same skill level.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1203_127_3</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Once you have beaten that league, you advance to the next where there will be better players, presumably now at you level, and you do the same for the next etc... If you want upgrades, just let me know and I'll have a think about how it could happen (I mean upgrades like ball upgrades etc ) 


Just brainstorming, tell me if any of this isn't possible or anything!!</TEXT>
