I was curious if I had misread the Diabetes thing but here is something from a recent [article](http://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/oct/09/tom-hanks-type-2-diabetes):

"The actor  who lost 13kg (two stone) for Philadelphia and 25kg for Castaway, and gained 13kg for A League of Their Own  said that "may have had something to do" with his having type 2 diabetes, "because you eat so much bad food and you don't get any exercise when you're heavy".</TEXT>

I'd rather not have any "controversial" calls or injured star players because then "your team really didn't win"....but teams can only play with those around them and we certainly don't have any influence on the refs, especially when Bo is screaming at them most of the time.</TEXT>
