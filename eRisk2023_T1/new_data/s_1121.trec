Kicks give more reach than punches do and in Olympic Sparring - taller fighters tend to ward off their opponents by using their reach to their advantage by keeping them at bay with long range kicks such as front leg Side Kicks whenever their opponent tries to step in to attack.</TEXT>

I've tried out a Judo/Jiu-Jitsu school once that claimed to teach "Self-Defense" (as many martial arts schools do nowadays) but only taught throws while completely neglecting how to get in position for a throw in no-gi and how to set-up a throw when an opponent is coming in with kicks and punches.</TEXT>

Obviously in real life, things would not go so smoothly and one cannot predict which direction the knife will come at them nor can they think that fast before they inevitably get struck at in a hostile situation where the attacker is motivated to strike.</TEXT>

In real life, those one-steps more than likely won't go down as smoothly as how you practice: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsLkqwQrCS8
