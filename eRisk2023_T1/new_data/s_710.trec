The law will force internet providers to record every internet customer's top-level web history in real-time for up to a year, which can be accessed by numerous government departments; force companies to decrypt data on demand -- though the government has never been that clear on exactly how it forces foreign firms to do that that; and even disclose any new security features in products before they launch.</TEXT>

Not even to mention the usual improvements on privacy invasion from the private sector in 2016, e.g., Google's recent policy change, Microsoft Windows 10 data collection, WhatsApp, Facebook announcing tracking nonFacebook users..etc.</TEXT>

Here's just a couple points to hint at what the report entailed (read the article for more complete version with sources):

[1] James Clapper himself admits that Snowden did not download all 1.5 million files he had access to, a number cited frequently in their report.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_710_845_2</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

[2] They cite mass downloading (this is where the 1.5 million files number comes from) as happening before Clapper lied to Congress, but Snowden maintains that the "mass downloading" was what he did as part of his job working under Heartbleed.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_710_845_3</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

[3] The report cherry picks a statement from a Russian politician as admittance of giving secrets to Russia, leaving out the "speculation" portion

[4] To quote the article's response to Snowden not being a whistleblower:

First of all, hiding behind the very technical, narrow legal definition of whistleblower is pretty ridiculous compared to the actual definition that most people use.</TEXT>

Also, interesting highlight from the article:

The story of APIC captures the bizarre reality of the U.S. political system: George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush between them appointed three of the five members of the Supreme Courts Citizens United majority; this majority opened up a loophole allowing foreign money to flow into U.S. elections; and this loophole was used to grab foreign money in an attempt to make a third Bush president.</TEXT>

See Cisco's role in selling surveillance equipment to China that was [**advertised** to hunt down a religious minority](https://www.wired.com/2008/05/leaked-cisco-do/) "that combines meditation and qigong exercises with a moral philosophy centered on the tenets of truthfulness, compassion, and forbearance" ([from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falun_Gong))

See the [brutalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Falun_Gong) of these people, such as **"some 64,000 Falun Gong prisoners may have been killed for their organs between the years 2000 and 2008"**

Here's my list of grievances for their reporting on:

weapons of mass destruction in Iraq[1];

intelligence Snowden totally gave to China[2];

withholding wiretapping stories during an election[3];

refusing to acknowledge US' role in bombing a hospital (until they do but explain how it was totally understandable[4]);

giving an piece to Mike Hayden defending drone warfare without acknowledging financial conflicts of interest[5];

using torture euphemisms to describe US torture programs[6]...

I remember seeing many commenters adamantly defending Cisco's role in selling surveillance equipment to China that was [**advertised** to hunt down a religious minority](https://www.wired.com/2008/05/leaked-cisco-do/)  "that combines meditation and qigong exercises with a moral philosophy centered on the tenets of truthfulness, compassion, and forbearance" ([from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Falun_Gong))

See the [brutalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persecution_of_Falun_Gong) of these people, such as **"some 64,000 Falun Gong prisoners may have been killed for their organs between the years 2000 and 2008"**

Now contrast that with what commenters here were saying [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wikipedia/comments/2ao2m9/falun_gong_is_a_qigong_discipline_combining/)
