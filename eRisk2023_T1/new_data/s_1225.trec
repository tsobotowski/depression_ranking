The Scriptures the Shepherds live by contain passages that can be interpreted as saying that oaths are not righteous (As I am incorporating a sort of Judeo-Christian worldview, the verses "Let your yes be yes and your no be no" come to mind, though I'm reading some interesting articles arguing otherwise at the moment)

In any case, in the event that I do decide to have an oath, it will be something like this:

*As surely as the Lord, God Creator, lives so I swear upon my soul this oath*

*With all my heart, I will serve the Monarch, Most High, with the strength of lions and the gentleness of lambs*

*With all my soul, I will hold the crook of the Shepherd, protecting the flock of the Lord, everything that is life.*</TEXT>

Per Wikipedia: 

Disney has been accused of anti-semitism,[193][z] although none of his employeesincluding the animator Art Babbitt, who disliked Disney intenselyever accused him of making anti-semitic slurs or taunts.[195] The Walt Disney Family Museum acknowledges that ethnic stereotypes common to films of the 1930s were included in some early cartoons.[aa] Disney donated regularly to Jewish charities, he was named "1955 Man of the Year" by the B'nai B'rith chapter in Beverly Hills,[196][197] and his studio employed a number of Jews, some of whom were in influential positions.[198][ab] Gabler, the first writer to gain unrestricted access to the Disney archives, concludes that the available evidence did not support accusations of anti-semitism and that Disney was "not [anti-semitic] in the conventional sense that we think of someone as being an anti-Semite".</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Gabler concludes that "though Walt himself, in my estimation, was not anti-Semitic, nevertheless, he willingly allied himself with people who were anti-Semitic [meaning the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals], and that reputation stuck.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>He was never really able to expunge it throughout his life".[199] Disney distanced himself from the Motion Picture Alliance in the 1950s.[200]

Disney has also been accused of racism because some of his productions released between the 1930s and 1950s contain racially insensitive material.[201][ac] The feature film Song of the South was criticized by contemporary film critics, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, and others for its perpetuation of black stereotypes,[202] but Disney later campaigned successfully for an Honorary Academy Award for its star, James Baskett, the first black actor so honored.[203][ad] Gabler argues that "Walt Disney was no racist.</TEXT>
