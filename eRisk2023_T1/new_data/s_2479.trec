My personal opinion is people should be able to choose whether to donate their bodies to science, yes it would help but it will take a long time for people to be okay with not having a body to bury or cremate and say goodbye to.</TEXT>

I think people can get over and come to terms with organs being taken to help and that will continue to live on in someone else, with donating your body to science people imagine all sorts and don't want to think of a loved one going through that, even after death</TEXT>

People were there for me and looked after me when i was ill with my kidney because it was visible, i kept my depression from people and shut them out because i thought i was strange and broken, now i'm learning to let people in and feel the emotions and it's so much better, i talk to people and they understand better so they can help better in the future, instead of me just being angry or seeming moody, meaning they got fed up or angry they can now sympathise.</TEXT>

Anyway the point to all of this was, sometimes there isn't a reason, maybe there used to be and maybe there is one big thing that's caused your depression and makes it worse, but like my kidney once it was bad it was bad, and when it got worse sometimes it meant it was just taking longer to get better, do you see that depression is like that?</TEXT>

i used to have a high pressure job, now i work in a school, some days i need to come home or some days i cry to my colleagues, i'm a lot more emotional than i used to be, whilst that makes me feel weak sometimes i can see that it does help and it helps people around me see what's going on, it helps them help.</TEXT>

The fact is, it's lucky you don't have that previous job, that would have made you more ill in the future, it's a positive thing that you don't have to fly all over the world, work into the night, because at the moment you couldn't, you're doing so amazingly and as you get better maybe you can look to getting another high pressure job, or, maybe you can just enjoy finding other things to take up your time.</TEXT>

I literally agreed to stop trying for a baby for him, I would still be trying now because I'm so scared I might lose my chance, but I don't want to start taking the pill and mess up my cycle and condoms make me very sore after a while, he's also very large so it happens quicker.</TEXT>

I try and talk to my partner about how scared i am, about hearing that he's infertile etc and that i'm so scared of the fact that i won't ever conceive naturally, here in the UK you're entitled to IVF once, we wouldn't ever be able to afford it, so i've also had to come to terms with the fact that we will probably only have one child, at most.</TEXT>
