I liked Babidi and Dabura

I liked Majin Vegeta

I didn't like the fact that they were unclear about why Supreme Kai had to let Babidi's fighters steal Gohan's energy - I would've thrown in something about Babidi's magic preventing the Supreme Kai and Z Fighters from tracking him down - hence the need to let the lackeys lead them to the ship.</TEXT>

1 Abyssal Specter

Touches me on the leg to get my attention
