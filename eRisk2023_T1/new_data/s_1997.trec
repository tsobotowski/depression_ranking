Also, if you use clicker training a good technique is one of you hold your dog so it can't run, the other one excitedly call the puppy over and put tasty treats in the crate so the dog WANTS to go in, the person lets go, the dog excitedly goes in to get a treat, you click the clicker and praise him, then repeat!</TEXT>

The last school shooting (as far as I'm aware) we had in the UK was [dunblane](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunblane_school_massacre), which was 1996 and, as a result, we virtually banned private gun ownership and there hasn't been a school shooting since, and there's only been one (as far as I'm aware) mass shooting since, which was in Cumbria in 2010.</TEXT>

In a nutshell I have data stored on firebase than I want to randomly distribute, but in order of when it was submitted.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1997_168_2</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> For example:

People upload data (let's say a voice clip), I want to set it so on the app there's a download button and when a user hits it it checks for the voice clip at the front of the queue, checks it's not uploaded by the current user, if not it downloads the voice clip and adds "1" to the counter, and once the counter reaches 5 the voice clip is then put into a waiting bay, pending all 5 users who downloaded it rating it, whereby an action is taken.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1997_168_3</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

I ask this as I've just realised that all logic needs undertaken at the front end and not the back end, so I'm trying to implement the sorting of voice clips in line with the download button.</TEXT>

VideoView1.Swift

class VideoView1: UIViewController, DataSentDelegate {

    var player1 = AVPlayer()

And then later.......

    func playVideo()
    {
        let videoURL = URL(fileURLWithPath: "/Volumes/Mac HDD/Users/Pinchy/Documents/App/Ripple/Ripple/5secvid.mp4")
        player1 = AVPlayer(url: videoURL)


So I define player as a variable outside of any functions, but then give it a specific value within a function later?</TEXT>

My confusion was that I thought I had to go to the receiving view controller and make it a delegate there, but from what you've showed me, I need to preemptively specify in the sending view controller what the receiving view controller is called?</TEXT>

I've found tutorials online and followed several, but they *all* entail carrying data to another view controller as you move to that view controller using segue or prepare to segue.</TEXT>

I do think the metaphor you've cited is apt, but through tutorials and reading online I've managed to go from zero coding experience to a semi functional app that does what I want (even if the code is bastardised, but that's to be expected for a beginner), building this app is in itself the learning, not a shortcut to the end result.</TEXT>

My code is:

VIEW CONTROLLER:

import UIKit 
import AVFoundation
protocol DataSentDelegate 
{ 
func scrollViewDidScroll(data: CGFloat) 
}

class VideosViewController: UIViewController, UIScrollViewDelegate {

var delegate:DataSentDelegate?</TEXT>

override func viewDidLoad()

    super.viewDidLoad()
    videosScrollView.delegate = self
}

func scrollViewDidScroll(_ scrollView: UIScrollView) 
{ 
let width = scrollView.frame.size.width 
let page = scrollView.contentOffset.x / width
   
 // If whole number
    if page.truncatingRemainder(dividingBy: 1) == 0
    {
    // Print page number
    print("Page: \(page)")
    }
    // Pass required data to delegate
    delegate?.scrollViewDidScroll(data: page)
}


SUB VIEW (XIB FILE)
import UIKit 
import AVKit 
import AVFoundation 
import Firebase
class VideoView1: UIViewController, DataSentDelegate 
{
func scrollViewDidScroll(data: CGFloat) {
print("I'm on subview and Page: \(data)")
 }
}

Where I run my app and scroll between screens the console gives me the printed info from the view controller, i.e. "Page: 0" and "Page: 1" etc, but it isn't printing any info from the sub view, which suggests I've not set this up right and my data isn't carrying through to the sub view.</TEXT>

Got a quote from a joiner but it worked out cheaper to just buy a hue system; so far I have:
