At first sight their birth and death dates are not really suspicious:

[Antisthenes (c. 446366 B.C.E.)](http://www.iep.utm.edu/antisthe/)

[Diogenes of Sinope (c. 404323 B.C.E.)](http://www.iep.utm.edu/diogsino/)

However, the article about Diogenes is interesting and supports your version:

 Diogenes Laertius reports that Diogenes of Sinope fell in with Antisthenes who, though not in the habit of taking students, was worn out by Diogenes persistence (*Lives of Eminent Philosophers*, Book 6, Chapter 22).</TEXT>

 Philosophy and the Science of Human Nature ([PHIL 181](http://oyc.yale.edu/philosophy/phil-181))

 Professor Gendler begins with a discussion of the Stoic philosopher Epictetus, who argued that once we recognize that some things are up to us and other things are not up to us, we can see that happiness requires detaching ourselves from our desires and focusing instead on our attitudes and interpretations.</TEXT>

 This manifests itself in courage (the acceptance of all things that come), temperance (the acceptance of all things that do not come), justice (the recognition of ones' place in relation to others, and the associated duties), and wisdom (awareness of what all of the above mean)

In fact, it's even more complicated, since one is either virtuous or not without anything in between.</TEXT>

Today I have read the fourth book of Marcus Aurelius' Meditations and remember a [passage](https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/The_Thoughts_of_the_Emperor_Marcus_Aurelius_Antoninus/Book_IV) which may fit well:

 The analysis of the ancient evidence concerning Epicurus concept of pleasure is made according to the following principle: rst, I consider the sources that do not mention the distinction between kinetic and static pleasures, and only then do I compare them with the other group of texts which comprises reports by Cicero, Diogenes Laertius and Athenaeus.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_3099_760_5</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>From the former group of texts there emerges a concept of pleasure as a single and not twofold notion, while such terms as motion and state describe not two different phenomena but only two characteristics of the same phenomenon.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_3099_760_6</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>On the other hand, the reports comprising the latter group appear to derive from one and the same doxographical tradition, and to be connected with the classication of ethical docrines put forward by the Middle Academy and known as the *divisio Carneadea*.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_3099_760_7</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>In conclusion, I argue that the idea of Epicurus classication of pleasures is based on a misinterpretation of Epicurus concept in Academic doxography, which tended to contrapose it to doctrines of other schools, above all to the Cyrenaics views.</TEXT>

 **Abstract**

 Childrens *intelligence mind-sets* (i.e., their beliefs about whether intelligence is fixed or malleable) robustly influence their motivation and learning.</TEXT>

Some days ago I cited Marcus Aurelius at /r/Epicureanism, so let me cite Epicurus here (from the [Letter to Menoeceus](http://www.epicurus.net/en/menoeceus.html)):

 Let no one be slow to seek wisdom when he is young nor weary in the search of it when he has grown old.</TEXT>

I want to finish my comment with a quote from Marcus Aurelius ([Meditations, Book IX](http://classics.mit.edu/Antoninus/meditations.9.nine.html)):

 Epicurus says, In my sickness my conversation was not about my bodily sufferings, nor, says he, did I talk on such subjects to those who visited me; but I continued to discourse on the nature of things as before, keeping to this main point, how the mind, while participating in such movements as go on in the poor flesh, shall be free from perturbations and maintain its proper good.</TEXT>

    Like leaves on trees the race of man is found,
    Now green in youth, now withering on the ground;
    Another race the following spring supplies;
    They fall successive, and successive rise:
    So generations in their course decay;
    So flourish these, when those are pass'd away.</TEXT>

 **Summary**

 Although certain characteristics of human faces are broadly considered more attractive (e.g., symmetry, averageness), people also routinely disagree with each other on the relative attractiveness of faces.</TEXT>

 Despite the increasing attention that has been paid by contemporary scholarship to the place of philosophy within elite Roman society, this article argues that the extent of Epicurean affiliation during the Late-Republic has failed to be adequately recognized or narrated.</TEXT>

 This Masters thesis examines two conflicting images that can be presented in contemporary scholarship on the classical Epicurean movement: that they are either a reclusive and isolated group, or that they had a missionary dynamic/purpose akin to that seen in the later Christian missionary movement.</TEXT>
