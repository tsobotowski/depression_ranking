            	<TEXT>ramstein was also the site of one of the most disastrous accidents involving a plane in the 80's, there was an airshow there at ramstein AFB, the italian frecce tricolori was performing there, and unexpectedly, 3 aermacchi mb.399 (a trainer aircraft basically used by the tricolori at the time) crashed onto spectators and a medevac helicopter, after a botched attempted to get in formation and perform an aerobatics maneuver, killing an estimated 67 people, and injuring a total of 500 people.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>So recently, Nvidia announced that they're releasing the RTX 2050, exclusively for laptops Yes, RTX 2050, and i am not making this up, for those that havent catched up with the news lately I personally think it's kinda pointless when we have the RTX 3050, but however, i think it's nice for people that wants to experience what it's like to have an RTX GPU for a cheaper price.</TEXT>
