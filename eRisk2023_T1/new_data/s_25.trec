If I remember correctly, the novel points out early on that it is an older David who is recounting the story and as a result, several times, the perspective provided is one shared between two Davids: a younger one growing up, and the present one who provides snippets of additional 'wisdom' because he has the benefit of hindsight.</TEXT>
