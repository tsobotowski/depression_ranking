            	<TEXT>yeah sure in season 5 we didn't get much in terms of visual media besides the missions but I at least I still felt invested and excited every time a new piece of the quest came out and a new piece of ashes head were put together Alot of people complained about there only being dialogue so the devs got dark horse to draw the comics but it came at the cost of story since they needed to rush out the art, and the stories have been bad ever since and every time I see a new page come out I legit don't care also the pve missions had alot of potential as they could've served almost as CO-OP campaign missions since they were kinda like that but not the same extent you might see in other games, like just imagine that instead of just prowlers we could've had cool ass boss fights while yes comics are cool and all I prefer story over rushed art (yes ik they're getting help form the community but still) if you want to do an in game quest: just do what you did in season 5 but make the missions a bit more fun and less repetitive if you want to do a visual medium just hire a studio and pitch an animated show over all I really enjoy the universe that respawn has created so it hurts me to see the stories we don't care about rather than the ones we want, so please respawn make broken ghost 2 and make the quests good, please</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>1.i do know how to enjoy things its just that I cant adapt to the newer changes that have essentially jumbled the game in to a confusing mess at least for me 2.i never said things were perfect pre season 6 and the game still had problems like legends being under powered on release and some nerfs being horrible in season 5 along with season 4 feeling a bit like filler 3.well yeah dude I just said that I feel like I'm being forced too not just because of the money but mostly the time and effort I've put into the game and that if I stop now I will have wasted 2 years of my life 4.its just annoying to see the pros opinions be more valued than the rest of the community as apex in season 8 had just introduced kc into the game only for the pros to complain and take it out in algs 5.i don't hate Olympus but with a few changes i think it could be pretty solid I'm my opinion 6.of course I'm not having fun dude what did you think the title was?</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>More Pilot and Weapon Customization While Titanfall's gameplay and story are amazing I think it lacks in customization, it'd be cool if we could have some Halo like character customization where you could customize different parts of your pilot like the helmet, boots, shoulder, knees, etc, and you could buy those parts with credits (you get credits by simply playing the game and leveling up there's no way I ever want microtransactions to be in Titanfall) In terms of weapons tho I think we should have some base skins like Apex but have some exclusive skins for like 5 or 10$ 2.</TEXT>
