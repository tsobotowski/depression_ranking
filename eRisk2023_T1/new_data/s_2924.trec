            	<TEXT>Honestly, she probably figured out that I like her a long time ago, since I'm usually very closed off at work but I talk to her fairly often whereas I rarely talk to any of my other coworkers, and after asking her out three times... yeah, it's probably pretty obvious.</TEXT>

TL;DR - Been on three dates with my coworker whom I am very fond of at this point, told her at the end of the third date that I love spending time with her and would like to go out more frequently, she was flattered and said she loves spending time with me too and also wants to go out more often but she "isn't really looking for a relationship right now" because she just got out of a two-year-long one and it "ripped her soul apart".</TEXT>

-Speaking of which, if you're doing a Strength build, it's worth your time to explore the uppermost house full of Darkstalkers as one of the chests at the top holds a Greatsword, a very good PvE weapon.</TEXT>

Mega Blast is 1/5 as likely to spawn as any other devil room item, and there are 50 devil room items total, so that's only a 1 in 250 chance of seeing it appear any time you enter a devil room (assuming you don't get Krampus).</TEXT>

Things I've tried that didn't solve the problem:

-Deleting all local files and reinstalling without Afterbirth checked

-Verifying integrity of game cache, before and after reinstalling (the error message takes longer to come up when I do this but otherwise nothing changes)

-Restarting Steam

-Manually backing up and then deleting the files in *C:/Users/XXX/My Documents/My Games/Binding of Isaac Rebirth* before launching, as suggested by loads of people when Rebirth first came out in 2014

Playing on a Windows 10 laptop that far exceeds the recommended system requirements.</TEXT>

I just had a conversation with my parents in which we discussed how much college is going to cost, and in the same conversation they revealed that they are choosing to withdraw most of the financial support they had originally promised--they were going to pay for half of my college and now it's down to one-seventh for reasons they're not telling me.</TEXT>
