It's not about what large corporations *or* small businesses *think*, it's about the *fact* that there are millions of people with Celiac disease, and if they offer a couple of gluten-free items on the menu (which really isn't that hard or costly at all) they're opening up their market to a huge group of people who previously wouldn't have been interested in their restaurant/coffee shop/store/whatever.</TEXT>

So basically, for me it's not so much a matter of "someone said something about gluten and I'm taking it out of context and being sad about it," it's more a matter of "someone keeps perpetuating the idea that gluten free food isn't worth providing to people and now I can't comfortably go to most of the restaurants my friends want to go to because the only gluten free things they sell there are salads and if I have one more fucking salad this week I will scream"</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> I absolutely agree she should have called the FD/PD, but I'm sure it was difficult to even get a word in edgewise and explain what was going on while that guy was raging at her.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Plus, the guy who filmed it wasn't able to get his point across to the operator very well because the crazy dude just kept interrupting him as he was trying to explain that he was having an asthma attack.</TEXT>

It seems to me, though, like the operator wasn't really trained for emergency situations at all, because she handled it very poorly and didn't seem to know what to do.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> Exactly, and the way he kept referring to her as a "foul-mouthed young lady" and shit like that--like how prudish and ignorant do you have to be to hear the word "fuck" and decide that that is somehow grounds for arresting someone or refusing them care?</TEXT>
