I guess what I am getting at in this post, is that a one night fling is exciting and thrilling, a relationship when you are young is fun and full of new experiences, sex is possible after children if you are good at taking advantage of the brief moments you have alone together, and a long term sexual partner can let you discover so many new things about yourself and your partner and can bring a whole new dimension to your relationship.</TEXT>
