            	<DOCNO>s_785_119_4</DOCNO>

However such speculations will remain  mystery as the elevator has been held tightly under the thumb of the Atcotmivrosht, the followers of Cotmiv, who deny all entry to the elevator on the grounds of it being a place not to be seen by mortal eyes, and their presence amongt Mai's senior council has made any possibility of exploration improbable.</TEXT>

TL;DR: I've been communicating with a girl and have developed a fondness for her but don't know whether I should harness this fondness and channel it into making a lasting friendship with her, or whether I should push for intimacy ( which I am severely lacking in my life)."</TEXT>

Although I hope they would include more complexity, it's more realistic to think that if they did implement things like this, they'd probably be put in as quite simple, requiring maybe a single specialised workbench/item to turn say gut into string and hide into leather instead of a fully in-depth process.</TEXT>

The use of the whole hunted animal should be a defining feature of Rust early-game as it is pretty reminiscent of Neolithic life ( hunter-gatherers), and I believe that it could do with a bit of expansion so we don't just go from sticks and rocks straight to guns.</TEXT>

Fat: Can be rendered down in furnace to make glue, also used as fuel ( pretty sure Rust already has this,though)

I should probably mention that during this whole time communicating with her her I've been trying hard to balance the teenage urges of wanting to finally get my first-kiss/lose my virginity/have a girlfriend and my more realistic attitudes on the fact that she might not want to date me and that her friendship holds just as much value as a possible intimate relationship.</TEXT>

So, I'm left wondering whether I should deal with these urges to get a girlfriend by pushing for a more intimate relationship but risk ruining a perfectly good chance at a friendship, or whether I should play it safe but retain a possible deep-seated pining for her to view me as more than a friend that may lead me to becoming resentful and bitter.</TEXT>

I'm a bit new to this whole relationship-with-another-sex biz, being as I've had quite a bit of trouble with girls/women in the past and that I've never had a girlfriend/kissed/had sex/all that good intimate relationship stuff, so bear with me if I sound a bit naive or dickheaded as I'm pretty much running on a teenager's understanding of relationships.</TEXT>

You 'dated down' in looks to an acceptable level in your opinion; appearance still dictated who you went for as you specifically aimed to 'lower your standards', thus taking into account the fact that the girl you were looking for didn't quite meet your preference of appearance, and that you were conceding your 'decent looking' self to date someone lower or equal to how you viewed yourself physically.</TEXT>

It could be as simple as adding another modifier [Mortally Wounded/Internally Bleeding] to the player's status after being hit in a certain area (chest) or by a certain calibre weapon that stays with them until they die from it, (it would be random,of course) or as complex as having different types of internal injuries (lungs,stomach,intestines) lead to varying times of death, with characters who have been hit in places like the stomach/intestines periodically crumpling/falling over due to intense pain before dying a slow,agonizing death a short distance away from where they were shot in contrast to characters hit in the throat/lungs gasping for air and coughing up blood whilst squirming on the floor.</TEXT>

I am actually afraid to respond because I don't think I'd be able to do so with such sophistication, but you're right--I probably should have more empathy towards other people's loneliness, I do tend to forget that I'm not the only one who's hurting.</TEXT>

OP,you probably weren't using your sex to gain attention, however the responses you received weren't because you 'aren't allowed' to be FA, as some of the SRS posters are implying, but because you posted a seemingly normal photo of yourself attached to an arbitrary subject  to a sub that rarely has anything like that occur and consists mainly of lonely males.</TEXT>

This is the only place (at least, the only I know of) that people like us can come and whinge about our sad existences, so when someone comes around that seems like they have a normal life or should have a normal life, most of the time they're met with hostility, more so if they're female.</TEXT>
