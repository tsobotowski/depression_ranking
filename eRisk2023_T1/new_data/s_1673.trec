            	<TEXT> Steve was a man but only in name 

For his wife had his balls affixed to a chain 

And cry as he might, at any perceived slight 

She would never release his manhood 



Now Growing blue from the build up of splooge

It drew Steve of shives into madness anew 

Throwing his world into a feminist stew 

Where his only release is banning all but a few 



This is where Steve is resigned to stay 

Living out the remaining dregs of his days 

And what more else is there to possibly say?</TEXT>
