So, as you can see I've double down on Dark *(Dark BNS: 188)*, but I am wondering if just putting points into INT and FTH is the right plan at this point (I am thinking of getting both to 70 and then getting ATN to 75).</TEXT>

I would assume she can replace aging body parts with fresher parts, much in the same way rich people can get new organs.[[1](http://abcnews.go.com/Health/story?id=1514702)] Since it's been established that "candy biomass" is essentially interchangeable between candy people, I don't see why she wouldn't be able to get those fresher parts from her subjects.</TEXT>

2 [Fireblast](http://magiccards.info/vi/en/79.html)

4 [Browbeat](http://magiccards.info/tsts/en/56.html)

4 [Flame Rift](http://magiccards.info/ne/en/80.html)

4 [Teetering Peaks](http://magiccards.info/pd2/en/30.html)

16 Mountains
