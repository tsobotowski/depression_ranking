No, merely being "impaired" by alcohol doesn't constitute "unable to consent" under any law, in almost every case it's "incapacitated"

I was under the impression that if you were intoxicated to the point of being over the legal limit to drive that counted as unable to consent.</TEXT>

So to address your questions about what we can do about it, one of the reasons why cultural appropriation is so offensive is because white people stealing from ethnic minorities often involves a) stigmatizing the original culture they took it from and b) using whatever they take out of context.</TEXT>

In addition, there are also varying degrees of asexuality; there are people who are strictly asexual and never experience physical attraction, people who are allosexual (in otherwords, would identify as straight/gay/bi/pan/whatever), and people who are somewhere in between (demi, asexual-ish, gray-a, etc.).</TEXT>

And asexual people also have varying attitudes on sex; some of them hate or dislike sex and don't want to have it ever, some of them are sex positive and actually have a sex drive that just isn't directed at anything in particular, and some are neutral and don't care either way (I'm one of those).</TEXT>
