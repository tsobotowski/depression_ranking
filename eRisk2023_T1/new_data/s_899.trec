            	<TEXT> In periods of high feeding, you might have guessed it right, the HBP will produce an overabundance of of GlcNAc which will go on to alter the patterns in the way your cells O-glcnac modify proteins, which then goes on to change allllll those physiological processes I mentioned earlier.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> It is entirely plausible that fasting can lead to increased lifespan, because at least for carbohydrates we know that a molecule like GlcNAc and phenomena like O-glcnac is absolutely involved in aging and stress:

http://www.pnas.org/content/107/16/7413.full.pdf

TL;DR:  At least when it comes to high sugar consumption, there are many plausible mechanisms through which a lower calorie intake diet could promote longevity since we know sugars are involved in everything from heart disease, cancer, and diabetes, to basically regulating everything about how your cells work, including many areas related to aging and stress.</TEXT>

What's peculiar however is the fact that protein A seems to be much more active in cell line X.  I can directly measure the amount of metabolite the protein produces, and in cell line X, it produced several fold more metabolite than cell line Y even though cell line Y has the same or even more of protein A.   Disease is still more complex than this, as there are still several more layers of organization that are completely outside what is encoded directly in the genome.</TEXT>

https://www.reddit.com/r/baltimore/comments/1n0y9u/no_parking_within_30_feet_of_intersection/

Probably for safety reasons--it's literally impossible to see oncoming traffic when people park right on the corners.</TEXT>

This interesting paper describes how O-GlcNAcylation of PFK1 (the main regulatory enzyme of glycoslysis) directly controls whether or not glycolytic products will get shunted towards energy production or towards the PPP (for the production of nucleotides):

AMPK, a vital regulator of cellular energy metabolism is O-GlcNAc modified:
http://www.fasebj.org/cgi/content/meeting_abstract/22/1_MeetingAbstracts/614.7


Recent papers also now discuss how O-GlcNAc is pratically a 'master regulator' for all lipid biogenesis and metabolism, linking sugar/carbohydrate metabolism directly to the production or metabolism of lipids:
