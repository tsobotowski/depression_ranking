            	<TEXT>This is a speculation based on How Kaigaku as a demon has added black thunders when he uses his thunder breath which damages the skin and eventually leads to death if not treated immediately but on normal thunder breath, only speed bursts and flashes appear with minimal thunder effects not as much as a demon user.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Yeah thats what i said in the other comment, Just like how kaigaku had extra dark thunders when he used Thunder breath which causes skin tearing and later leads to death if not treated immediately, Kokushibo also had Crescent moon surrounding his sword slashes.</TEXT>
