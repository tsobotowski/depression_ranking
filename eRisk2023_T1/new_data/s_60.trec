and over night all republicans obeyed, they dropped the term global warming from their lexicon

and thats why climate change won out over AGW... despite in papers its still about 50/50


The phrase "global warming" should be abandoned in favour of "climate change", Mr Luntz says, and the party should describe its policies as "conservationist" instead of "environmentalist", because "most people" think environmentalists are "extremists" who indulge in "some pretty bizarre behaviour... that turns off many voters".</TEXT>

well A thats a fuck ton more clickable.. to say we are heading towards an ice age than 'the sun will have less spots than usual'

But yeah.. we had a busy sun.. and a strong el nino, that helped push 1998 record.. but heres the rub.. we have one of the quietest suns we have seen already.. we are coming out of a protracted minimum.. not as bad as maunder but the worse since direct records.. right now.</TEXT>

the effect sunspots have on climate, while REAL.. it is a plus/minus in the big ass equation, is minor as fuck.. and there were other mins besides maunder.. and we really didnt see much of a change in temps.. the little ice age, started before the sunspots got low.. it doesnt look to be even global and definitely had other causes besides sunspots.</TEXT>

the model suggests we will hit [Maunder Minimum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maunder_Minimum) like sunspot levels.. and thats way more than 60% drop

Sprer noted that during one 30-year period within the Maunder Minimum observations showed fewer than 50 sunspots, as opposed to a more typical 40,00050,000 spots in modern times

but the solar irradiance [hasnt fluctuated more than 0.2% in the past 2000 years.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_variation)

mans influences are stronger than that.. wow.. 

we were actually entering a cooling phase by the tilt cycle that lasted for nearly 2000 years, until... about 150 years ago.. when the industrial age happened.(and yes notice that "mini ice age" happened in that period) But notice back 370 years ago.. what wasnt happening, was man wasnt spewing all this carbon into the air.. ok we spewed a lot but  to even compare how much we spewed back then versus today we would have to have a logarithmic graph because we spew exponentially more than they did back then...


to long didnt read, there is a fucking reason why newyork is surrounding itself with sea walls and florida is surrounding its cities with huge drains and water pumps and why russia put a flag on the sea floor in the arctic and why exxon decided to not exploit a field because it would be the single biggest carbon emitter if they did and they dodnt want that advertisement.</TEXT>

for the "flag run" folks.. yeah it sucks,  and no not defending .. what they did was wrong.. ABSOLUTELY.. they shouldnt have thrown shit at your truck, but also know that if you are an insensitive bigot and drive through minority neighborhoods where people are a bit offended by that flag... well your going to be more likely to have shit thrown at you.. not that it justifies anything but if you purposefully drive through a minority neighborhood trying to provoke this reaction, you too are part of the problem.. not just the people throwing shit.</TEXT>

Thats not at all what the 'scientists predict'

Yes some solar scientist do predict a drastic reduction in solar activity and yes  the last time the earth saw this low of solar activity was during the "mini ice age"  which was mainly limited to europe, even the americas while colder wherent in an ice age and the southern poles seemed to completely miss it...and thats where the truth leaves the barn in this article.</TEXT>

[I figure the downvotes are due to it being inconclusive on why their is a positive correlation between drinking diet soda and waist size gain in older adults.](http://www.science20.com/news_articles/diet_soda_frequency_linked_to_waist_size_increases-154618)

I believe they arent sure if its has something to do with the alternative sugars and their digestibility, or does the ingestion of diet coke change eating habits.</TEXT>

there have been a couple posts of mine, that made it to teh front of reddit, where comment information changed what the title should say.. and my title was suddenly misleading IMO and i couldnt do anything about it.. and since so many people dont click through or read the comments, .. i was doing damage that i couldnt stop.</TEXT>

i am glad these days they have at least let mods add a little flair to titles so they can say "debunked".. or "mirror in comments".."not real, viral ad" but they really should let us to fix titles... hey send a message to everyone who voted that the title was changed to let them change theri vote.. fine, but they should let us fix titles.</TEXT>

dude came back that satan would fool the world by being a good dude... just like the pope.(which basically they have their bases covered cause he can be anything from insanely evil, to a really good dude)

But to make a long ramble have a point...

Even if some christians might think what they are doing is good and noble, they might still think they are actual satanists... er worship some dude called satan cause being good is exactly one of those dirty rotten things satan might do.</TEXT>

i recall fox news getting upset at a mexican flag flying over a post office in a mostly spanish town in the us.. despite that town used to be part of mexico and it was part of their heritage(personally i agreed with fox.. it had no place flying over the post office)

and [then is this lady who stole the mexican flag from a e mexican grocery  because this is america not mexico](http://www.rawstory.com/2015/02/muslim-hating-mexican-flag-stealer-delivers-bizarre-anti-tyranny-prayer-to-the-tenn-senate/)

however I dont think that matters, since OP, was claiming "jesus is claimed to be real because people wont follow non existent teachers"(though muhammad tried just that.. it just didnt work out too well for him).. to me it doesnt matter if paul invented him or not.. paul is saying HE WAS A REAL PERSON.</TEXT>

the [fact is her polling is pretty steady about  60%](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/2016-national-democratic-primary)

and if you [go back and look at 2008]9http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationwide_opinion_polling_for_the_Democratic_Party_2008_presidential_candidates)

Obama simply didnt have the same level of favorability in the dem party as Hilary is right now.</TEXT>
