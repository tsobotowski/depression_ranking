It suggests to me that this chart could be improved with some color palette choices that are more intuitively associated with the energy sources:  

1) Coal - Dark Grey, same as it ever was  

2) Nuclear - Try to match the color of Cerenkov radiation color, Electric Blue,  Hex triplet, #7DF9FF

Off the top of my head I can think of at least two others where the titles did match up: "Four Weddings and Funeral" and "Look Who's Coming To Dinner", both remakes that seriously sucked compared to the originals

While you don't say how far above you, Larry Niven had a great mnemonic for non-technicals living in a weightless orbiting environment ("The Smoke Ring"):  

East takes you Out, Out takes you West, West takes you In, In takes you East  

Basically, if you're in a lower orbit than the space station, it is above you, but would be falling behind you because your lower orbit means you're moving fasting.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>From the original paper summary  

A trade-off between survival and reproduction is evident throughout the geographical ranges of our study species: resprouting species with fire-protected buds had much higher fire survival than nonsprouters without fire-protected buds (97% vs. 2%) but they also had substantially lower fecundity and recruitment rates.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>We found little intraspecific variation in fire survival rates but considerable intraspecific variation in fecundity and recruitment  

Basically it says there wasn't much variation in fire survival between different species, but there was a big variation between species in their subsequent bloom fertilization (ie "recruitment") and seed production ("fecundity").</TEXT>

On a broader scale, the research finds the species distribution of shrubs in an area damaged by fire changes in the years after the fire, with some species assuming a greater percentage of the total population/biomass whereas other species declining in population percentage.</TEXT>

It is unclear whether they're saying the archaic modern human/neanderthal cross completely died out, or is included in the Neanderthal genome V.c (europeans, asians, etc) carry in their DNA  

It also seems like they're saying the Australians/PNG natives don't include the Neanderthal genes, just the Denisovians, questioning whether that is a separate branch.</TEXT>
