Specifically at issue are Comey's statements that:

1) Top Clinton aide Huma Abedin forwarded hundreds and thousands of emails from Clinton's private email server to her husband, disgraced former congressman Anthony Weiner, as part of a regular practice of forwarding emails for Weiner to print out for Clinton, and 

2) These emails contained classified information.</TEXT>

The statutory definition of treason, codified at [18 U.S.C. 2381](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2381) pursuant to Congress's constitutional power to punish treason, defines the offense as:

---

Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, [1] levies war against them *or* [2] **adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere**, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and **shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States**.

Merriam-Webster [defines enemy](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/enemy) as:

1:  one that is antagonistic to another; especially :  one seeking to injure, overthrow, or confound an opponent

2:  something harmful or deadly 

3

a :  a military adversary

b :  a hostile unit or force

Under these definitions there are good arguments for deeming Russia an enemy for purposes of treason based on their subversion of the election.</TEXT>

Alternatively, you have the definition of enemy at [50 U.S. Code  2204](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/2204), which states:

As used in this chapter [*i.e.*, [Chapter 39 of Title 50](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/chapter-39)]

...

(2) the term enemy means any country, government, group, or person that has been engaged in hostilities, whether or not lawfully authorized, with the United States;

(3) the term person means

(A) any natural person;

(B) any corporation, partnership, or other legal entity; and

(C) any organization, association, or group

By its own terms, this definition does not control uses of the term "enemy" in Title 18 (where the statutory definition of treason appears)--only Chapter 39 of Title 50.</TEXT>

Merriam-Webster [defines hostilities](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hostilities) as:

a :  deep-seated usually mutual ill will 

b

(1) :  hostile action

(2) hostilities plural :  overt acts of warfare :  war

2:  conflict, opposition, or resistance in thought or principle

There's a decent argument under the plain meaning that "hostilities" does mean "overt acts of warfare."</TEXT>

If Russia isn't precluded as a matter of law from being an "enemy," I think that there's a good argument to be made that emnity can be inferred from a factually intensive inquiry into the nature of the act itself--especially if we go with the first plain meaning of enemy as "one seeking to **injure**, **overthrow**, or confound an opponent."</TEXT>

The agreement to subvert our election would also likely satisfy the "**adherence to the enemy**" element of treason (which could be further inferred from the delivery of pro-Putin policies detrimental to U.S. national security and use of the hacked information knowing that it was unlawfully obtained and disclosed under this illicit deal).</TEXT>

It's probably impossible to objectively discern intent from an overvote ballot that has marks by more than one Presidential candidate's lines--even if one mark is visibly stronger than the other, or is partial (a possible exception would be where one bubble were erased but registered by machine as an overvote due to smudging).</TEXT>

This is notable because there were a substantial number of votes statewide [where Gore's name was both punched in *and* written in](http://rinr.fsu.edu/winter2005/features/battlefield.html), causing a ballot to be "spoiled" (*i.e.*, registered as an overvote) and not counted by machine even though the voters intent was unambiguous.</TEXT>

Source close to April Doss tells me she was brought on by the Dems and will work full time on Trump-Russia probe

The former head of intelligence law at the National Security Agency (NSA), April Doss, has been hired to work on the Senate Intelligence Committee's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election, her law firm confirmed in a press release on Wednesday.</TEXT>

Doss, who spent over a decade at the NSA and now chairs the Cybersecurity and Privacy practice at Saul Ewing, LLP, will serve as the committee's special counsel as it examines "allegations that Russia participated in a disinformation campaign intended to benefit President Donald Trump, and claims of potential collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia," the firm said.</TEXT>

The committee hasn't issued any subpoenas or requested any key documents such as emails, memos, and phone records from the Trump campaign, in part because its chairman, Sen. Richard Burr, "has so far failed to respond to requests from the panel's Democrats to sign letters doing so," Isikoff reported.</TEXT>

My main objection is that Comey sent the extremely vague initial letter:

(1) without conducting a preliminary review of the laptop emails and excluding duplicates [even though the FBI knew about it for 3 weeks beforehand](http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-fbi-emails-investigation-20161102-story.html);

(2) knowing full-well that it would leak, and having explicitly acknowledged (*in his words*) the "[significant risk of being misunderstood" if it did;

(3) against the advice of subordinates and superiors, and in violation of long-established DoJ and general investigatory protocol;

(4) while applying a completely different standard to public disclosure of the FBI's still ongoing investigation of Clinton's opponent (see below);

and

(5) just 10 days before the electionwhile millions of people were already votinghaving apparently calculated, in part, that Clinton was far enough ahead that it wouldn't matter (which would be totally inappropriate even if Comey were correct because of the letters potential impacts on the victory margin as well as downballot races).</TEXT>

In his unshakable [self-righteousness](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/02/opinion/campaign-stops/james-comeys-self-righteous-meddling.html?smid=tw-nytopinion smtyp=cur), Comey was convinced that his own moral compass and judgment was correct and that everyone else was wrong.</TEXT>

Also, to be clear, the "current political climate" of which you speak entails:

(1) the passage of 142 years since the uprising by white supremacist dead-enders of the earlier failed rebellion they'd mounted to preserve the right to keep black people as draft animals;

(2) the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution abolishing that repugnant institution, at great cost in blood;

(3) the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment formally granting former slaves full citizenship and equal protection under the law; and

(4) a Civil Rights Movement to end a century of Jim Crow, during which this illusory promise of full citizenship for blacks existed only on paper.</TEXT>

(1) without conducting a preliminary review of the laptop emails even though the FBI knew about it for 3 weeks beforehand;

(2) knowing full-well that it would leak, and having explicitly acknowleged (in his words) the "[significant risk of being misunderstood](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-nation/wp/2016/10/28/read-the-letter-comey-sent-to-fbi-employees-explaining-his-controversial-decision-on-the-clinton-email-investigation/?utm_term=.5b2bc866f165)" if it did;

(3) against the advice of subordinates and superiors, and in violation of long-established  DoJ and general investigatory protocol;

(4) while applying a completely different standard to public disclosure of the FBI's *still ongoing* investigation of Clinton's opponent (*see my reply to the post above*);

 and 

(5) just 10 days before the electionwhile millions of people were already votinghaving apparently calculated, in part, that Clinton was far enough ahead that it wouldn't matter (which would be totally inappropriate *even if* Comey were correct because of the letters' potential impacts on the victory margin as well as downballot races).</TEXT>

In other words, if Comey had never taken that step, we might currently be discussing the staying power of the Obama coalition and the success of the Clinton strategy  in particular, the emphasis on attacking Trumps dangerously unhinged temperament, and his campaign of racism, hate, and abuse directed at Mexican immigrants and women  in driving college-educated whites into the Democratic camp.</TEXT>

Gorsuch's obsession with wording and the "plain text" of laws has led many to note his similarities with the man he is replacing, the late Justice Antonin Scalia.</TEXT>

Scalia was known for his adherence to textualism - a manner of interpreting laws in accordance with their plain text, rather than by assuming or inferring the intent of lawmakers, or the potential consequences of the laws' implementation.</TEXT>

While many of Gorsuch's rulings show he too is a clear adherent to textualism, perhaps nowhere is his dedication to unearthing the meaning of a law as "the words on the paper say" more noticeable than in one 2015 decision in which he used "plain old grade school grammar" to determine the legal penalties imposed on defendants accused of using a firearm "during and in relation to any crime of violence or drug trafficking crime."</TEXT>

###[TL:DR]

The victims' (supposedly fake) symptoms suggest that a nerve agent, like Sarin, was used in this attack.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_2330_600_2</DOCNO>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_2330_600_3</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Moreover, nerve agents are unlikely to have been stored in a manner that could have caused them to be released by accident in an airstrike, and if stored that way would likely have been destroyed (nerve agents are binary, and unless mixed, won't have the neurotoxic effect).</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>

In addition, there is other forensic and circumstantial evidence inconsistent with the Russian version of events (*e.g.*, lack of a fire, timing of the Russian claim) and no evidence for that version has been proffered, according to the articles below.</TEXT>

Prominent on the surface of any case held to involve a political question is found [1] a textually demonstrable constitutional commitment of the issue to a coordinate political department; or [2] a lack of judicially discoverable and manageable standards for resolving it; or [3] the impossibility of deciding without an initial policy determination of a kind clearly for nonjudicial discretion; or [4] the impossibility of a court's undertaking independent resolution without expressing lack of the respect due coordinate branches of government; or [5] an unusual need for unquestioning adherence to a political decision already made; or [6] the potentiality of embarrassment from multifarious pronouncements by various departments on one question.

Impeachment is defined by [Article II, Section 4](https://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/articleii#section4):

The President, Vice President and all civil officers of the United States, shall be removed from office on impeachment for, and conviction of, treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors.</TEXT>

Article III, Section 2 merely says that:

The trial of all crimes, **except in cases of impeachment, shall be by jury**; and such trial shall be held in the state where the said crimes shall have been committed; but when not committed within any state, the trial shall be at such place or places as the Congress may by law have directed.</TEXT>

The statutory definition of treason, codified at [18 U.S.C. 2381](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2381) pursuant to Congress's constitutional power to punish treason, defines the offense as:

---

Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, [1] levies war against them *or* [2] **adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere**, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and **shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States**.

Merriam-Webster [defines enemy](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/enemy) as:

1:  one that is antagonistic to another; especially :  one seeking to injure, overthrow, or confound an opponent

2:  something harmful or deadly alcohol was his greatest enemy

3

a :  a military adversary

b :  a hostile unit or force



Alternatively, you have the definition of enemy at [50 U.S. Code  2204](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/2204), which states:

As used in this chapter [*i.e.*, [Chapter 39 of Title 50](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/50/chapter-39)]

...

(2) the term enemy means any country, government, group, or person that has been engaged in hostilities, whether or not lawfully authorized, with the United States;

(3) the term person means

(A) any natural person;

(B) any corporation, partnership, or other legal entity; and

(C) any organization, association, or group

By its own terms, this definition does not control uses of the term "enemy" in Title 18--only Chapter 39 of Title 50.</TEXT>

Merriam-Webster [defines hostilities](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hostilities) as:

a :  deep-seated usually mutual ill will 

b

(1) :  hostile action

(2) hostilities plural :  overt acts of warfare :  war

2:  conflict, opposition, or resistance in thought or principle

Under either meaning of the term "enemy," but especially the first (non-statutory), it's not clear that Russia would be held *as a matter of law* NOT to be an enemy for purposes of treason.</TEXT>

You'd have:

(1) a candidate for President of the U.S. agreeing with a foreign adversary 

(2) that the foreign adversary would unlawfully obtain information about his opponent and then wage a disinformation and propaganda campaign through selective disclosure of the opponent's dirty laundry, coupled with fake news stories to weaponize the disinformation, and bots to promote it on social media, as well as covert funding of the campaign and possibly side payments, bribes, and sweetheart business deals not at fair market value (this is the ***quid***)

(3) *in exchange for* (***pro***) U.S. government policies favorable to the foreign adversary, and detrimental to U.S. national security interests (*e.g.*, weakening NATO, lifting sanctions for the annexation of Crimea) (this is the ***quo***)

(4) *while* lying to the electorate about the existence of this unlawful agreement and the foreign adversary's interference in the election--even when the opponent explicitly brings up the issue

(5) *while* shamelessly and knowingly mischaracterizing, exaggerating, and otherwise playing up the significance of illegally-obtained information about the opponent

(6) *while* the opponent continues to abide by campaign finance, anti-bribery and other legal restrictions that the candidate is circumventing himself through the unlawful agreement.</TEXT>

Further, if Trump knew that Russia leaking the info (through intelligence briefings he received as the Republican nominee), that's also material, since he denied it even as [he lied about and exaggerated the content of the leaks](https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/12/how-trump-made-russias-hacking-more-effective/511880/).</TEXT>

You'd have:

(1) a candidate for President of the U.S. agreeing with a foreign adversary 

(2) to unlawfully obtain information about his opponent and then wage a disinformation and propaganda campaign through selective disclosure of the opponent's dirty laundry, coupled with fake news stories to weaponize the disinformation and bots to promote it on social media, as well as covert funding of the campaign and possibly side payments and bribes (this is the ***quid***)

(3) in exchange for (***pro***) U.S. government policies favorable to the foreign adversary, and detrimental to U.S. national security interests (e.g., weakening NATO) (this is the ***quo***)

(4) *while* lying to the electorate about the existence of this agreement, which is itself unlawful, and falsely denying the foreign adversary's involvement in the election--even when the opponent explicitly brings up the issue

(5) *while* shamelessly and knowingly mischaracterizing, exaggerating, and otherwise playing up the significance of illegally-obtained information about the opponent

(6) *while* the opponent continues to abide by campaign finance, anti-bribery and other legal restrictions that the candidate is circumventing through the unlawful agreement.</TEXT>

Assuming these issues could be resolved, two crimes Sessions could theoretically be charged with are:

---

[18 U.S. Code  1001](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1001) (False statements)

*Or*

[18 U.S. Code  1621](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1621) (Perjury)

If I were prosecuting him, the way I'd go about it is by juxtaposing Sessions' in-person and written testimony against (1) the timeline (he failed to correct his testimony for weeks, even after Flynn resigned for lying while not under oath), (2) his [initial press statements](https://twitter.com/chrisgeidner/status/837136512915501056), (3) the [trial balloon excuses that have subsequently unraveled](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/5y3kfs/al_franken_i_think_jeff_sessions_committed_perjury/den0ga6/), (4) the [doubling down](http://www.grassley.senate.gov/sites/default/files/judiciary/upload/Sessions,%2003-06-17,%20letter,%20testimony.pdf) after being scolded by Trump, and (5) the [subsequent revelation that he met with Kislyak a third time](http://m.huffpost.com/us/entry/us_58c05639e4b0d1078ca37225/), which boxes him in.</TEXT>

The statutory definition of treason, codified at [18 U.S.C. 2381](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/2381) pursuant to Congress's constitutional power to punish treason, defines the offense as:

---

Whoever, owing allegiance to the United States, levies war against them or **adheres to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort within the United States or elsewhere**, is guilty of treason and shall suffer death, or shall be imprisoned not less than five years and fined under this title but not less than $10,000; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.</TEXT>

Subverting an election for the highest federal office likely meets this test if there was an explicit *quid pro quo* to secure illicit Russian campaign assistance (and possibly funding) in exchange for U.S. foreign policies desired by Putinincluding a weakening of NATO, the U.S.'s principal military alliance, and consequent impairment of the U.S.' ability to "resist or to attack [its] enemies."</TEXT>

There are two types of vote wastage Im concerned with: (1) votes that don't count because another candidate has at least one more vote in the electoral district; and (2) useless excess victory margin in an electoral district that can't offset opponents votes in other districts because of the geographical line separating the districts (*i.e.*, more votes than are necessary to guarantee a win given the number of votes cast).</TEXT>

As for the broader significance, I honestly have no ideaexcept it would tend to show that whatever Euron is planning in TWOW probably matters for Daenerys end-game, since GRRM bothered to foreshadow it almost 20 years before, in ACOK, as part of one of the most scrutinized passages of the whole series.</TEXT>

As you can see in the map above, Hardhome, as well as the site of the possible Hardhome crater, is located on the northwest side of a peninsula protruding into a large gulf or sea at its southern endjust like the [Chicxulub crater](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicxulub_crater#/media/File:Yucatan_chix_crater.jpg).</TEXT>
