1) The stray demon has the Titanite slab, and its beneficial to the CU to fight him, therefore, the floor was either broken by a third party trying to help you (velka, possibly gwyndolin) or was broken during the same time dilation that all of Lordran is experiencing (enemies are different in the asylum too, you could have escaped thousands of years ago)

2)Peculiar doll is likely supplied by Velka, seeing as the painted world is the best grinding area in the game, and gives you lots of god killing items, and also has a strong Velka association.</TEXT>

5) This is a genuine oversight, much like ciaran using the dark/gold tracers after giving them to you

I also feel that AOT is really unable to provoke 'the feels' in me, because I've seen the 'Mother dies in front of protagonist's eyes' trope so many times in comicbooks, as well as Mikasa's backstory and charactrer being similar to Claymore backstories. (</TEXT>

I also feel that AOT is really unable to provoke 'the feels' in me, because I've seen the 'Mother dies in front of protagonist's eyes' trope so many times in comicbooks, as well as Mikasa's backstory and charactrer being similar to Claymore backstories. (</TEXT>

Season 2 would focus around a spec ops's style team, composed of Satsuki, Tsumugu, Uzu, Inamuta and nonon, trying to dismantle Revocs, which is now under the control of Rei, who is attempting to bring about the return of the live fibres (Sorry to Gamagoori fans, but if he was in the series people would focus way too heavily on his character, and, due to the season finale, we know there's no danger to him, also, the season would become about Mako/gamagoori shipping again) Ryuko and Mako don't appear, leaving their lives ambiguous.</TEXT>

*Satsuki has to reconcile her current life as the 'good guy' with the fact that she was essentially a fascist dictator, and killed innocent people to create a gambit that didn't work


*Tsumugu finds out more about his sister, his reasons for joining nudist beach, and his relationship with his allies, who he has been trained to hate.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> The only way KLK could work as a game is Persona 4 arena/ Jrpg style, however, I've had a fairly good Idea for season 2:

Season 2 would focus around a spec ops's style team, composed of Satsuki, Tsumugu, Uzu, Inamuta and nonon, trying to dismantle Revocs, which is now under the control of Rei, who is attempting to bring about the return of the live fibres (Sorry to Gamagoori fans, but if he was in the series people would focus way too heavily on his character, and, due to the season finale, we know there's no danger to him, also, the season would become about Mako/gamagoori shipping **again**) Ryuko and Mako don't appear, leaving their lives ambiguous.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>The show would be scaled down from kill la kill, having more grounded action and more characterization, as the life fibers have been destroyed, (comic relief is kept up by bickering, as is the hectic animation) therefore, the series focuses on Tsumugu and Satsuki making elaborate, batman esque plans, and having them usually horribly fail due to bickering and infighting, however, there are clear character arcs and motivations that the characters can undergo, further expanding and elaborating on the core series:

*Satsuki has to reconcile her current life as the 'good guy' with the fact that she was essentially a fascist dictator, and killed innocent people to create a gambit that didn't work


*Tsumugu finds out more about his sister, his reasons for joining nudist beach, and his relationship with his allies, who he has been trained to hate.</TEXT>

I don't think still supporting the Makogoori ship is unjustified, but saying it's the only canon ship is ludicrous,and there was no need to make that derogatory comment, I'm simply saying that if characters specifically talking about a DATE, they might be talking about, y'know, a date.</TEXT>

However, as the dream went on the robot made of bears started walking over a town , more specifically, Brighton, England, I had to keep ducking my head because for some reason, and I have no idea why, the people walking on the street, people I knew from school and stuff, were pulling out SNIPER RIFLES and specifically trying to shoot me.</TEXT>

Ok Lewis, har har, youve had your fun, but come on we all know you dont have a superweapon Duncan had walked up to the top deck now, Flanked by Rythian, who had a tired, exasperated look that only the partners of the pirate king could know
I DO BELIEVE, I CAN ANSWER THAT PARTICULAR QUESTION said a voice lewis hadnt heard in a long time; Stepping out of the bushes, garbed in full navy uniform and a sword that seemed to be glowing with energy, was pyrion flax.</TEXT>
