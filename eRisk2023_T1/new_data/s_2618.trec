**TL;DR**: if a song starts on and seems based around a chord that isn't the root or its relative minor, do you still call the root note the key, or do you go by the most frequent chord/'key centre'?</TEXT>

Overall it was a perfect **gaming** experience, and I truly think that in terms of pure gameplay (i.e. every part of MGS that isn't story), Kojima achieved everything he set out to when he made those claims early in development that this would be his masterpiece and the pinnacle of his career.</TEXT>
