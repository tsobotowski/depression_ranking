            	<TEXT> Originally posted on /r/frugal, it seems there's enough interest for me to post here as well  :D

I wrote this years ago, but it's still as useful now as it was then   it's getting to be that time of year, where it's cold enough to help keep the smells down :D

This is an awesome resource for all sorts of things   can be a fun hobby

I live in a small-ish town, so I'm not lucky enough to have very many dumpsters to dig through, but the ones I've found are practical goldmines.</TEXT>

My main problem in my town is that all the big grocery stores have compactors.</TEXT>

my bf   I went together, it's more fun with a friend, plus it's a peace of mind thing as well (personally, I wouldn't go alone, but I'm a 5'3" female, so it's not like I could even see into most dumpsters *LOL*)
It depends on where the dumpster is, but usually I'd park in front of the business I'm diving at,   just cart the stuff over (or if it's a large haul/something heavy, I'd put it to the side of the dumpster   just pull up to put it in the car, then leave)

Most dumpsters I only spent about 10 minutes at, but there was one (for an office supply store) that I'd crawl up on the side of it   dig for anywhere up to an hour.</TEXT>

I got married in 2013, for probably the least romantic reason ever - basically to make sure that if anything happened, we'd be each other's proxy for emergencies

I live with my husband,   he supports me, but all we ever do is fight anymore   he doesn't love me (this isn't speculation, he actually told me this, he doesn't feel love)
the only time he ever wants me in his life is when things are going well, which they haven't been for a while as I'm not getting the emotional intimacy that I need,   I feel so very alone

we moved 1500km away from our hometown 2 years ago,   not like it would have mattered, as I didn't have any friends there   I don't have any friends here.</TEXT>

I just feel like I have nothing left to live for.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> I'd just like to clarify a few points that my husband seems to have overlooked

Before I even start: when we got together, I was very up front   clear about the fact that I didn't want children, I'm an artist,   I want to be a housewife.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_2852_129_5</DOCNO>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_2852_129_6</DOCNO>

            	<DOCNO>s_2852_129_7</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> I shouldn't have to pick his clothes   anything he's gotten out in the last month up off the floor just so I can sweep (which i would do if there wasn't shit all over the floor)

Three: I'm not a neat freak.</TEXT>

Four: He has NEVER brought up 90% of this with me, despite me telling him that he needs to communicate with me   tell me what's wrong.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_2852_129_10</DOCNO>

Five: My husband neglected to mention that for a year, my art was the only real income we had, while he worked MAYBE 20 hours a MONTH.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_2852_129_12</DOCNO>

Also, while he was only working 20 hours a month, he didn't chip in   help out extra around the 'house' (we were living in a camper van at the time), so I was still expected to do all my domestic duties on top of churning out as much art as I was physically capable of, just to keep us afloat.</TEXT>
