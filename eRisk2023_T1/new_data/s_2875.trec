So basically they're very weak and getting a power supply of 1000V in a limb would be difficult and maybe dangerous (physics isn't my specialty but I don't know of a compact, lightweight and long-lasting 1000V power supply - someone else might be able to shed light on that)

From an insurance agent/spokesman:
**If** this test showed 100 per cent probability over a certain number of years then it could affect premiums

It's a good reminder to scientists that you need to be crystal clear when talking to journalists about work, the lead author said nothing misleading at all but probably should have explicitly stated something along the lines of  "this work may lead to a predictive biomarker for cancer in the future but in it's current form and with our current understanding cannot currently be used as a clinical prediction of cancer".

Overall, I wouldn't say it's a good paper due to the one time point, poor presentation of the blots, the fact the phospho-blots aren't normalized to the respective total (HSL is normalized to GAPDH which is a loading control, which though not ideal is better than not normalizing it) and not measuring circulating levels of satiety hormones.</TEXT>

The paper (see here, open access: http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/wp-content/uploads/advpub/2015/1/ehp.1408698.acco.pdf) wanted to see if the beneficial effects of exercise on mortality were changed if exercise was performed in a more polluted area.</TEXT>

The benefits of exercise can include increased strength, mitochondrial density and endurance, additionally the mitochondria and cells are better able to resist oxidative stress (http://hyper.ahajournals.org/content/54/6/1206.full that's free access not the best source as it refers more to exercise with people with hypertension but the same effects are seen in healthy people).</TEXT>

Here the high levels of pollution are 6-times that in this study (120ug/m3 NO) and their minimum levels are the high level in the Copenhagen study.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Tissue engineered muscle has poor transfer of force to the extracellular matrix and is less dense than native muscle and this way of testing force doesn't allow you to test those properties.</TEXT>
