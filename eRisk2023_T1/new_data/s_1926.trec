First, there were three scenes in the movie which had me very confused.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1926_1_3</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>All three of them had to do with various characters passing "it" on.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1926_1_4</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

1) after the main character and Greg have sex, they show Greg talking to a group of girls and flirting with one of them

2) the main character sees the men on the boat and strips and swims out to them

3) Paul is in the city after having sex with the main character and sees the prostitutes

So my question is whether or not these scenes had anything to do with them passing "it" on.</TEXT>
