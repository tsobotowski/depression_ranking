EDIT: To add to the fact that he continued gaming when i got back from work, I am just more annoyed that I have to ASK him to stop repeatedly and he always asks for a little more time and I usually give in and say fine, but a little time turns into hours and then i turn into a "nag", as he says.</TEXT>
