            	<TEXT>

My guess is they *haven't* stopped, because now they are selling $107-$161 Atom chips as "Celerons" and "Pentiums" in the PC market, which allows them to even give away the *mobile* targeted chips for free if they want.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>

In my opinion that's quite anti-competitive because for instance they could push Snapdragon 820-competitors into $100 phones, where other ARM makers would have no chance to compete and push them out of the market until they are dead, and then raise prices.</TEXT>

They did that already with the Zenfone 2 where they pushed a 810-level chip (or close to it) into a mid-range $300 device which would normally get something like a Snapdragon 615, and people were "impressed" by what powerful Atom chips can be in a mid-range device - when in fact this was *only* possible because of Intel's heavy (and unfair) subsidies.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Well you don't, or at least you won't, because Intel will eventually cut the subsidies, and then because people "want Intel" (like it happened with the heavily subsidized Haswell Celeron Chromebooks) Intel will spike the price and OEMs will have no choice but to continue using those chips.</TEXT>

Also, I think Tesla's official numbers may be more accurate, kind of how Apple's battery life numbers are (or at least were in Steve Jobs' days, now I think Tim Cook has started exaggerating a bit, or at least mentions the light usage as if it were moderate usage) more accurate than most laptop manufacturers' numbers, which tended to claim battery life numbers that were about 2x what you'd get in the real world (remember those 8h battery life claims with 6-cells in 2009 or so?</TEXT>

For instance, I saw a recent review of the Renault ZOE, and they said it has a 130 mile range, yet the reviewer put it more at like 80 miles (~130 KM, which is about 40% less).</TEXT>

Yet, in countries like Germany subsidies for renewables were already cut after about 5 years only, and in the US they are about to go down from 30% to 10% in a year and I think completely gone by 2020.</TEXT>

The problem with leaving subsidies for much longer than 10 years or so is that the industry gets accustomed to that money from the government and doesn't invest in increasing efficiency as much as it should when they are forced by the market to drop prices below a certain price level.</TEXT>

And no, I don't just say that because "Linux is more secure than Windows" or whatever, but because the fact that 90% of the world's computers run on the same OS means a TON of people are invested in exploiting it, which means it's not just a top priority for *many* governments to hack it (not just China or Russia, who would focus on breaking the US gov's Linux distro anyway, but others with lower budgets as well) and it's also much easier for them to buy exploits from the black market.</TEXT>

Also, the fact that Intel has to do emulation for many apps means that the chip will perform less well than otherwise, and it will also [consume more power](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/05/02/arm_test_results_attack_intel/):

 The results weren't pretty: when using binary translation on this CPU-centric benchmark, power consumption went up nearly 90 per cent and performance dipped by over 40 per cent.</TEXT>

But returning to this issue, this treaty not only *allows* the NSA (and the rest of the Five Eyes nations) to keep buying zero-days from those same "evil hackers" the the treaty is meant to stop, but it actually *forces* good security researchers to share their zero-days exploits with the NSA (kind of how [Apple](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/02/12/obama-to-sign-executive-order-on-cybersecurity-threats/) has agreed to do recently voluntarily and how Microsoft has been doing it for a [long time](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2013-06-14/u-s-agencies-said-to-swap-data-with-thousands-of-firms)), so the NSA can exploit them themselves.</TEXT>

ARM chips:

The Patriot Act Section 215 was *mainly* about phone records (although they probably interpreted it to mean Internet records too in some cases), but the FAA 702 and EO1233 allows them to capture *all web traffic*, including content, which also includes your Skype calls, emails, SMS, chats and so on.</TEXT>

Solid state batteries also seem to have 50-100% higher density (up to 1200Wh/liter) than regular li-ion batteries, higher life cycles, and they are safer too (due to lack of liquid electrolyte), which could be great for electric cars.</TEXT>

This is unlike virtually all of its competitors who want to be "futuristic" or whatever with their electric cars on the outside, which makes them look weird on the road, and many still haven't completely redesigned their cars to be fully electric from the ground up, and instead re-use some of the old design and stick a battery and a motor inside, which makes them less efficient as EVs.</TEXT>

http://motherboard.vice.com/read/one-of-the-biggest-privacy-wins-in-recent-memory-has-been-reversed

Solution:

1) Use only services *based* outside of US (make sure they don't have servers in US, because many foreign services do)

2) if you do use a US service to store your data, you have to encrypt it locally on your PC before uploading it, and only you have to have the key

3) use only end-to-end encrypted communication tools (Signal/Textsecure, Peerio, Tox, etc)</TEXT>

I understand why people say they need a hybrid though - the range may not be good enough yet for *some* or for a certain lower price point, but as batteries improve in cost (and they do by 8% each year), EVs will become "good enough" for more and more people.</TEXT>

1) weak security (much weaker than Vista+)

2) no updates to at least keep the zero-day vulnerabilities in check

With Android 5.0, Google has also given OEMs great camera APIs with high performance processing, so now they can't use the excuse that it's Google's stock software anymore or anything like that (even though I think most of the big OEMs have been using their own custom firmware for a while, and they haven't been using Google's firmware much).</TEXT>

Lavaboom seems to have experienced some issues lately, including a DDoS attack and losing a developer:

https://twitter.com/LavaboomHQ

Peerio as well as miniLock are open source:

https://github.com/PeerioTechnologies/peerio-client

https://github.com/kaepora/miniLock

Audit of miniLock (although in this case an audit of Peerio itself would be preferable): https://cure53.de/pentest-report_minilock.pdf

I think what isn't open source about Peerio is basically the storage service.</TEXT>
