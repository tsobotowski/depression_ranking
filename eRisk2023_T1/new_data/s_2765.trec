**Environmental Groups Change Tune on Nuclear Power**

Focus on climate change has raised profile of reactors, now viewed as reliable, carbon-free source of energy

By AMY HARDER

Some of the nations most influential environmental groups are softening their longstanding opposition to nuclear power, marking a significant shift in the antinuclear movement as environmentalists priority shifts to climate change.</TEXT>

The change is lowering one of the biggest political hurdles facing the nuclear power industry in the U.S. and comes at a critical time, as several financially struggling reactors are set to shut down.</TEXT>

Because the historical context is that these groups were opposed to nuclear, their absence on the opposition front is noticed, said Joe Dominguez, executive vice president for governmental and regulatory affairs for Exelon Corp., the biggest owner of nuclear plants in the U.S. I think its pretty significant.</TEXT>

Most environmentalists have long opposed nuclear power due to a host of concerns, including the risk of a catastrophic accident (a worry heightened by Japans Fukushima disaster in 2011), unresolved questions on radioactive waste storage, the potential for weapons proliferation from the fuel and a preference for renewable energy such as solar and wind.</TEXT>

The problem that needs to be regulated is the human population itself...

While I don't necessarily disagree with population being out of control and a culling would help the problem, poor countries have tiny emissions per capita, and much of the development work, at least where I've been involved, is focused on non-fossil fuel energy.</TEXT>

If I'm reading you correctly, you're factoring in that "trading just to trade" crowd as part of S/D by default

What I'm saying with deliverability is: If there futures contract price is that out of whack with the physical markets, physical players will make or take delivery.</TEXT>

This is mainly due to a backlog of between 800 to 1,000 uncompleted wells statewide, about 125 of which need to be completed by the end of June in order to comply with state requirements to complete drilling within a year.</TEXT>

Followed by his conclusions based on assumptions in a vacuum, specifically:

"This effect is exacerbated by the fact that the excess supply of money incentivizes producers to restrict production causing a leftward shift in the supply curve"

The devastating effect of neonicitinoids on bees, worms, butterflies, birds, and other creatures necessary to humans (still definitive causal linkage needed, but before conclusive evidence, the populations will be decimated).</TEXT>
