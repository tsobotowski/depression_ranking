I ended up finding a PI who studies something that I think is absolutely fascinating (diving physiology), who has a fantastic network already, and that I get along well with, and although we're not at a "top-tier" university, I feel like the implications of the research I'm doing and the opportunities I've gotten through my advisor's connections are going to surpass any advantage I'd have had I just gone to a well-known marine biology program for the sake of getting a degree from a big name school.</TEXT>

The dogma in marine mammal physiology for the last 70+ years was that marine mammals simply cannot get the bends, or decompression sickness (DCS) - that they must have adaptations that made it impossible, such as their ability to collapse their lungs, slow their heart rate, quickly ventilate, stop blood from going to their lungs, etc.</TEXT>

So, although the exact cause of "the bends" or decompression DCS is not known, there is (in my opinion) overwhelming evidence that nitrogen bubbles forming in the blood and body tissues are the culprit, or at least involved in the process.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> As the animals dive deeper and deeper, more and more of the air in the lungs can diffuse into the blood (deeper water = [greater pressure = more dissolved gas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry's_law)).</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1198_36_17</DOCNO>

Now, there are a ton of issues associated with releasing the whales, which I [answer in detail here.](http://www.reddit.com/r/marinebiology/comments/1thxi6/marine_biologists_of_reddit_could_sea_worlds/ce8cq7s)  Another wrinkle I didn't mention before is that a majority of the whales have worn out teeth that have been drilled out and need to be flushed regularly to avoid infection - so that would also cause an issue with release.</TEXT>

Keiko (Free Willy) was released in the general area that he was captured in and was seen traveling with other whales from time to time, but it never seemed that he was accepted into any pod.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> In his 1867 book *Mimicry, and Other Protective Resemblances Among Animals* (and later, his 1879 paper published in *Science*), Alfred Russel Wallace suggested stripes evolved in order to provide camouflage from predators by allowing zebras to blend in with the surrounding area.</TEXT>

This particular hypothesis was refuted by Darwin and others since the stripes do not blend with the usual zebra habitat of short grasses, but the more recent adaptation is that the stripes confuse predators by making it difficult to single out an individual in the group.</TEXT>
