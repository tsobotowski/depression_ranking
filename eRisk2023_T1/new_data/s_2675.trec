 "After Garner expressed to the police that he was tired of being harassed and that he was not selling cigarettes, officers moved to arrest Garner on suspicion of selling "loosies" (single cigarettes) from packs without tax stamps.[15] When officer Daniel Pantaleo took Garner's wrist behind his back, Garner swatted his arms away.[16] Pantaleo then put his arm around Garner's neck and pulled him backwards and down onto the ground.[17] After Pantaleo removed his arm from Garner's neck, he pushed Garner's face into the ground[18][19] while four officers moved to restrain Garner, who repeated "I can't breathe" eleven times while lying facedown on the sidewalk.[7][20][21] After Garner lost consciousness, officers turned him onto his side to ease his breathing.</TEXT>
