The options I'm trying with is using normal orientation of the book but flipping the page all the way around and drawing on the back, or I can start from the back and work through the book backwards, or to keep the drawings on I guess "the front" I can turn the book upside down and work "backwards"

I've compiled a short list of the problems I've seen or experienced myself (and unfortunately I've experienced a good chunk of them):

* easily scratched camera lens that will cause blurry pictures

* "loose" audio jack.</TEXT>

However, one person has made a habit of not telling anyone about the giant to-go orders and putting them in the computer last minute as if they didn't require any extra attention than regular orders, and on top of that, she justs takes the amount of soup she needs from the hot wells that are there for the servers to get soup for the dine-in guests.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1805_1162_3</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>I then raised the threshold to 10 bitcoins, but I only got to 2.88 bitcoins before I lost my interest because at the time (and even now) I don't have a lot of money and couldn't afford to replace my gpu if it died an early life from being ran at 100% for so long, especially with bitcoins being as cheap as they were.</TEXT>

So here's where I made my 3 essential mistakes:

1: I didn't pay attention to what I was doing

2: I left bitcoins in the mining pool account

3: I didn't continue mining

I got a new larger SSD and backed up some stuff onto an external and wiped the old one for a fresh install of windows.</TEXT>

So then I fast forward to about a week or so ago when bitcoin flew past 700+.</TEXT>

It's kindof a bittersweet ending, because yeah, I still am out 2.88BTC, and the full amount could have paid for half of the debt I'm in, and I'm sure if I waited out longer, I could have paid it all off in full which would have been great because all the money going towards bills could be put back into investing in bitcoin.</TEXT>

My parents met us at the hospital but it would have been too many people in the room so they had to wait outside and my wife had to sit and answer more questions and by this time that medicine had worn off so her arms were wretching again and her heart rate was high but after a bit she calmed down without needing any meds because she knew she was near the end of the journey and she would get to rest somewhere peaceful and quiet so she could heal.</TEXT>
