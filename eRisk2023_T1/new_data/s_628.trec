It's interesting to me how the most likely scenario here is that they don't get any of the protected draft picks and end up with only 1 in 2015, but there is an incredibly small possibility that they could end up drafting #1, 6, 11, and 19 this year if some games and ping pong balls break their way.</TEXT>

I give Florida State the nod (trying to be impartial here) because they won three conference championships to OSUs one, their worst season was significantly less bad than OSUs (finishing 9-4, ranked v. a losing season at 6-7), Ohio State went through NCAA sanctions and have had three head coaches in these five years (both of which I think of as a sort of intangible negatives), Florida State has the Heisman winner, and Florida State has the better overall record.</TEXT>

**#10 TCU** - Overall record: 47-17 (73.4%), conference championships: 3, national championships: 0

Major bowl appearances: 2, major bowl wins: 2, bowl wins: 3  

TCU is definitely no higher than 10th, namely because two of their three great seasons were played with Mountain West Schedules, and then went 11-14 their first two seasons in the Big 12 which gives them one of the biggest negatives of any team on this list, with those taken into account and with only the 15th best record in the FBS these past years I was tempted to leave them off.</TEXT>

Kareem Abdul jabbar- 9   
Kobe- 8  
Lebron- 8  
Dominique Wilkins- 8  
Alex English- 8  
Wilt- 7 (including a 4000 point season)  
Oscar Robertson- 7    
Dirk- 5  
Allen Iverson- 5 (and a 1989)  
Jerry West- 5  
Larry Bird- 4

Elvin Hayes- 4  
David Robinson- 4

Patrick Ewing- 2  
John Havlicek- 2

If we assume (incorrectly) that all of these are independent probabilities, that puts our title chances at .75 x .6 x .1 x .15 x .125 = .085% and that's being very optimistic

I think it's just important for people to understand that, while obviously this is not true for everyone within any disadvantaged ethnicity, and while people definitely are able to overcome those disadvantages, there should be *nothing* controversial about suggesting that when you have these debilitating factors occurring at a much higher rate, you're going to have issues like crime, STD transmission, and poverty rising at a higher rate.</TEXT>

It's also important for people to not ignore or be ignorant to the lack of culture that we established, and the intensity of the systematic discrimination for black people specifically that disallowed them to just "overcome" these disadvantages like other ethnicities have (asian populations in california etc.)</TEXT>

I saw you say that you're a criminal defense attorney, and I'm just a 2L fresh out of crim pro, so I certainly give deference to your opinion, but...

            	<TEXT> Reddit, I'm reposting this from the John Paulson loophole thread because I missed the boat aready

I'm not going to comment on whether or not this type of loophole should be closed, but I think understanding the system a little better could be help put into perspective why he's only paying 15% in taxes:

There are generally two main ways for the government to tax.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>So AFTER the corporation is taxed once, the government puts a 15% tax on the distribution of that money to it's owners.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_628_1072_6</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

for instance, hypothetically if the corporate rate is 35% and the capitol gains rate is 15%, that means for every dollar a corporation earns only 1(1 - .35)(1 - .15), or 55 cents actually makes it to the owner, so people who make money through corporations would be effectively taxed at 45%

REMEMBER THOUGH, employees (you guys) salaries are deducted from pretax net income, so the money the corporation makes that ends up in your pockets will only be taxed once, at most for 35%.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_628_1072_7</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

SO, when a man like John Paulson makes his income, it comes out of the AFTER TAX Net Income of the company, because his earnings are benchmarked by the after tax profits of the corporation, not the PRETAX Net Income of the company like most employees.</TEXT>
