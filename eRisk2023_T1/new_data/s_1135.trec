Me: "Well, the bad news is that since that key needs a chip to work, the key will be another $60 on top of the original $35 to make it"

C: "hang on, -salvage guy- told me that you could make it for 35 and in a few minutes, not a hundred in a couple hours"

I ran a few small test batches that went well, then the first real batch was just iron oxide and aluminum powder, 30 grams/10 grams, respectively, and I got a somewhat pure chunk of iron, although there was a crust of aluminum oxide around it.</TEXT>

 It'd need to be heated and consolidated a few times to be useable, but it's about 26 grams and there seems to be no aluminum in it, so I only lost 4 grams of iron, and it's probably just because a portion of the thermite didn't ignite.</TEXT>

The bottom, solid part, seems to be mostly ferrous(i moved around the whole thing with a magnet), while the top fluffy looking part is not at all, so I'm guessing all the steel melted to the bottom whole the aluminum mostly sat on top.</TEXT>

Lamp Guy: "Yes, my wife was taking out Christmas decorations, and we were going to use this lamp, but the mice chewed through the cord, and I need a new lamp"

Me, my dad, and the old guy that I was helping are all just kinda looking at each other 

Dad: "I'm sorry, you need a new lamp?"</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>You can try the hardware store up the road though"

Lamp Guy: "I already went there, they can't fix it, this is my last place to check"

At this point the old guy that I was helping first is done, but he's still here listening to it and we're all trying to figure out what's going on in this lampy's head

Old Guy: "if you go down to the hardware store you can buy an extension cord and just splice the ends together, it's not a hard fix"

Lamp Guy: "But I already went there and they couldn't fix it"

Old Guy: "Well you can still get the parts and just do it yourself"

Me and my dad both just sit back and let these two guys argue it out for 10 minutes while they both repeat the same things back and forth to each other until they decide to take it outside for a few more minutes.</TEXT>

Edit 2 because some people can't seem to grasp that both services and goods cost money:

Service call = $40, this is the basic local "gas and services" charge.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1135_236_30</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>An extra $10 is added on for every 10 miles away, so her total service call was 50

Fitting a key to a car when they've lost it = $35 usually, and this involves either peeking inside the lock and reading the pins, or taking apart the lock.</TEXT>
        </DOC>

            	<DOCNO>s_1135_236_32</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Key programming = $40, this is a set price because some cost more, some cost less, and we only charge to program keys that require us to hook up our machine(which by the way costs several thousand dollars, plus several hundred per year) to their car.</TEXT>

I never saw Steve again, and that was nearly 10 years ago now.</TEXT>

I never cut myself or attempted to kill myself again, for fear that I would look up and see HIM.</TEXT>

His icy cold stare, his suit as black as the moonless night, his dastardly sneer, and the nothing that lie behind it.</TEXT>

I buried this memory in the deepest recesses of my mind, hoping it was all just a dream, my imagination.</TEXT>

I was browsing the internet, and I came across a post made by someone talking about their imaginary friends, and one of them I had realized bore a striking resemblance to Steve.</TEXT>

It was at that moment, when the icy chills ran up and down my spine, that I realized that Steve was not my imaginary friend at all.</TEXT>

He was certainly not my friend, I had known that for years now, but now I knew that he was, beyond a shadow of a doubt, NOT imaginary.</TEXT>

And so I write this as a warning, if you see Steve, whatever his name may be, in his black suit and coat, his pale skin, dark eyes, and that horrifically twisted smile, you need to stop what you're doing to draw him in, stop bringing pain upon yourself, and don't let him get any closer to you.</TEXT>
