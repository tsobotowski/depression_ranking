I can't stand to see the world any other way 

Too bright, too dark,

I'd rather not see at all 

But the smoke builds just enough of a wall

Between me and you 

Us and them 

All building walls 

Over and over again 

The day is too cold, the sun too bright

It's all too much 

I'd rather build my walls and such

I'd rather stay warm and veiled in smoke 

I'd rather build barriers and be alone</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> Once a world of black and white 

Now a plane of greys

Gone is all the vibrant light 

Missing sun-bright rays

Things are dim

Numbness sets in 

Playing a game that I cannot win 

I'll say sorry every time 

I'll let you hurt me 

I'll accept your lies 

I'm sorry, my dear 

It's all my fault 

Sorry for my tears 

I can't help that they fall 

I wish I was better 

I'm doing everything wrong 

I try to be enough 

But I guess I'm not strong 

Strong like you, 

The fighter, the yeller

My love, it's true

I'd let you love me black and blue 

I'm in love

It's not fair

Yes it hurts

I don't care 

I'm sure I will 

One day

I'll have my regrets 

Things could get better

But I'm nearly faithless

I want things to be fine 

I want things to be right 

But my hope fades more

Every time that we fight

I'm sorry, I'm sorry 

For bringing it up 

I'm sorry for staying 

I'm just trying to be enough

If you want it to be an entire spin-off series, I'd give it a title that hints back at  "How to Survive In Hell" so that it might attract fans of the first one, but still have a relatively original title for the new series.</TEXT>

Was when I was a Princess

Because you were the King

My title never meant a thing

Bestowed me a crown, 

A gift to yourself

To prove you were kind

To everyone else 

It's all about you

It's all just a show

I'm perfect, justly so!"</TEXT>

We're all pawns, we're all planets 

You are self-dubbed the Sun 

For without us in orbit

Narcissism hasn't won

Sit on your false throne 

Claim yourself as righteous King 

Believe the worlds orbit you

Though you're really nothing

That I never receive 

You'd think I'd learn my lesson 

After what you did to me

Asking for permission

I'll do anything you say 

A master of submission 

I'm so easy to sway 

You don't deserve my time

You don't deserve my love 

My heart's stuck in a vice 

I can't help but crave someone

Anyone, anything

Doesn't matter who

I'd do anything for attention 

I'm a simple, tasteless, fool

When everything is over 

I'll move on to the next one

I apologize my dear

I can't help but to crave blood

Take me, suffocate me

Gasping, clawing, reaching for breath 

Life shattered, please replace me

-//-

Sing the song of my demise

The soundtrack of each piercing slice 

Watch my body crash to the floor

Take me under

My life is yours 

-//-

Hear the call of death itself

The screeching in this silent house 

The scratching, creaking, whispery noise 

The cries of those without a voice 

-//-

Take me away from my pain

Tip the king of my chess game 

The pounding heartbeat finally stops

No more time left on this clock

-//- 

Rushing, racing, 

End awaiting 

Life ticks by

I fall, complacent 

Death looks up to me 

From the pavement

Perfect smile, skin fair

Liked by all, loved by none 

Pretty girls are heartless ones

-- //

Sweet words to public eyes

A pretty face

Most classic disguise 

Charming voice tells ugly lies

-- //

Classic stereotype

Rings so true

Mean girl clich 

Is once again proved 

-- //

You hated me so 

You told me to die 

Harsh pretty face 

Bid me goodbye 

-- //

Wrote me off

And cast me aside

Then acted aloof

When they discovered I died

A day of young ones

A traditional feeling of seeing green.</TEXT>

By those standards, not as shady, but slightly annoying that they didn't respond when I was checking to see if they were using the story, because I didn't reply to a separate narration request from someone else due to the fact that they never responded if it would be okay for another channel to narrate it (was not sure at the time what the media release would mean) and by the time I realized they were not using my story, it had been weeks since the other channel asked me and I felt bad for not replying sooner, and I don't think they narrated it either.</TEXT>

Don't second guess your stories, if you think that the quality of your writing was bad, or you left obvious plot holes, or something that would make *you* not read the story, then I can understand removing and reworking it, but if you thought it was good, and can't find a real issue with it (not counting the fact that most of us hate what we've written soon after it's posted, that issue doesn't count) then leave it up.</TEXT>

One of my stories is in the top of the week with ~2000 votes, a story I wrote two days after, and that I believe is equally good, albiet less twisty at the end, is sitting around with like thirty something votes?</TEXT>

With the new one, I wasn't exactly out of ideas or hating the story yet, but the timing didn't give me a lot of time to get things down the way I wanted, and after not updating for a week I felt pressured to put it out faster because I was messing with the timeline of the story by not actually having the real time to put into it.</TEXT>

This is actually the best idea, because though my second part was never well received, I decided to overlook it because the part I'm working on has a lot of potential and I'm happy that I don't have to directly continue on a story line that I lost hope in, but still get to use the base idea of the first post.</TEXT>

* REC (all three were good, not sure of they're still on because this was a few years ago)
