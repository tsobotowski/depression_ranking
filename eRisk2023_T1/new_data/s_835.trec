Sunfire Insurance is denying the insurance claim for coverage on the home fire due to the following:

According to the local police department and the fire sheriff's office, the property fire at 1823 Red oak Road, Maynardsville on June 8th, 2015 at approximately 12:45am was deemed to be intentional, malicious and caused by the resident or residents.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_835_93_11</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

I understand that this is likely to come as a shock to you, but the evidence found was unmistakable.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_835_93_12</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> After an exhaustive search of the remains of the property the fire inspectors tracked down the origin point.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_835_93_13</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> They found that the electrical socket on the Eastern end of the master bedroom was the source of the fire.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_835_93_14</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> Normally an electrical fire would be fully covered, however the cause of this particular electrical fire was a small butter knife which had been bent and inserted into the outlet.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_835_93_15</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

The police and fire department did report that they had seen cases where there was accidental insertion of objects in this manner, however our final assessment is that the fact that the knife was bent in half, and both ends were positioned quite clearly to fit the outlet rules out any chance of accident in this case.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_835_93_16</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Furthermore the police have determined that in all likelihood, this action was taken by a resident or both residents of the home.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_835_93_17</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> There were no signs of break in and no police reports of strange activity from the tenants or the neighbors.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_835_93_18</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> Furthermore it seems that your brother and partner only knew one resident of Maynardsville who was quickly cleared of suspicion.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_835_93_19</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> There are no other suspects who may have had intention to do the residents harm.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_835_93_20</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

It is therefore the determination of the police department, fire department and our company that on the night of June 8th, 2015 at approximately 12:45am one of the two residents of the property in question intentionally bent a knife, inserted it into the electrical socket in the master bedroom, and then got into bed.</TEXT>
