As for the copying and pasting, if you don't have any programming experience try using web scrapers like this one: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-scraper/jnhgnonknehpejjnehehllkliplmbmhn?hl=en

Not sure if that specific one is good but try using something like that to save yourself from having to copy and paste everything.</TEXT>
