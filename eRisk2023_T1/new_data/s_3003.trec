            	<TEXT>So now we're waiting for my SO to meet his GP to see what he says next Tuesday, then we have our first appointment at a fertility clinic on May 23rd, and like you, I have no idea what to expect between " It's not so bad and can be fixed with vitamins etc" or "IVF with ICSI is your only option"... :(
I hope you get better news next time..

u/HermesHippie I'm still new to MFI stuff, what do you mean when you say morphology is trickier than other metrics?</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> Ahhh crap that sucks... we're in a similar boat, my SO's first Sa came back with just 1% normal morphology, which equates with pregnancy being possible only with IVF and ICSI... however, all the ladies on here have said not to panic before getting more answers, and a 2nd SA, as numbers can vary quite a bit between 2 different SA's... SO has a follow-up with his GP next week which will hopefully give us some info, and then we meet an RE on May 23rd, which is when I'm expecting real answers and a game plan... which will hopefully not be straight to IVF.</TEXT>

My SO was a little bit like that in the first few months, telling me we should try to not take it too stressfully at first, saying it's normal it takes time... Fast forward to 8 months trying, only 2 ovulations, and his recent SA for which he has a follow-up appointment on May 9th (which might be because it wasn't great), he is starting to feel the discouragement and the sadness, and is now more understanding of how this whole TTC thing really is stressful no matter how hard you try to relax.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> Yeah I've had 2 different rounds of bloodowrk done with nothing really abnormal, except my TSH which is too high for TTC and 1st trimester from what I hear, but my doctor won't medicate for the level I have... And I had 2 ultrasounds which were normal... Same here I have to wait but I'm asking my GP to refer me to a gyno or an RE so that I can get better answers soon.</TEXT>

My SO had an SA done recently and has a follow-up with his doctor about that on May 9th, which is too fucking far away, expecially since I'm afraid it wasn't great if he needs a follow-up appointment...

So it's all in the waiting, and I am not a patient person haha so it sucks real bad..</TEXT>

We started TTC mid-August as well and my charts are respectively 106 days, 56 days, 41 days and currently CD41 again with no O so far...

Exactly, I don't get why they don't work to get it under control before pregnancy, especially as it's super important right at the beginning... It's not logical, sometimes it feels like all they want to do is push meds, and other times they won't fix something that is easily fixed...</TEXT>

My TSH has been at 3.7-3.9 since October and she insists that it's not cause for meds or a referral to an endocrinologist despite my Mom having Hashimoto's, my grandma having thyroid problems as well, me being extra-tired all the time and my cycles staying long and irregular, with 2 ovulations in 8 months... I'm getting pissed but feel pretty helpless as I don't know who to turn to next for medical advice...</TEXT>

As for OPKs, me too, I do have a second line but it's always lighter than the control and it seems to just darken, then lighten, then darken again... I don't know what time is best to take it either so I usually do it between 12 and 4 p.m...

Anyway, hang in there and good luck!</TEXT>

By the way didn't mean to offend anyone with weight issues/prejudice, it's just that PCOS is so often represented with the typical picture...

I am definitely asking for more in-depth bloodwork, as I have doubts on my thyroid as well, which could be causing some of the similar issues</TEXT>

I'm only in cycle 3, but have been trying since August, so if you do the math my cycles are not regular at all so far... 

Cycle 1: 106 days anovulatory (that was such a loooong time to just wait for something to happen, anything at all), had an ultrasound around day 90ish which showed a 3-cm kyst on my left ovary.</TEXT>

I'm in the awkward  stage in-between TFAB and stilltrying... In a similar situation to yours, I never had regular periods before starting HBC at 15, and when I stopped in August, it took me 3 months to get a period... I don't have PCOS (that I know of, my doctor seems to think I'm not a prime candidate for it even though I've got some symptoms) but my cycles are not regular at all.</TEXT>

Was planning on asking for more blood tests for hormones to make sure things were okay since I had been having super long cycles and only ovulated in January (stopped HBC in August)... But now I've just ovulated again on CD22 instead of CD41 like last time, which is good, but kind of makes me feel like a fool for asking my doctor for more tests to know what's wrong with me!</TEXT>

But I feel a little bit in-between, with some TFAB posts from first-time BFPs can come off as irritating I agree, but also I've been lurking on stilltrying for a few weeks and have seen quite a few comments like the one above, which to me comes off as a bit hurtful (because I feel like I'd be judged for posting on stilltrying being only 6 months in) and intimidating.</TEXT>

I totally agree that there definitely can be a lack of perspective from those only a few cycles in, but that's something I think we only realize once we're further down the road and we *do* have that perspective of having tried for a while and realizing that it's not that easy.</TEXT>

I highly suggest temping to confirm ovulation, that way you know that if you ovulated late (for example, on CD 25 instead of CD15) so you won't think your period is 10 days late and stres about getting BFNs and not knowing what is going on!</TEXT>

For my hair, I used to easily go 2 days, and be able to stretch for a 3rd day, and now I stretch to 2 days :( I've started using Lush's Restauration shampoo and I love it, as it takes care of my oily roots without destroying my ends too much (I've got long hair and it's blonde, so the ends break super easily).</TEXT>

So I'm currently on CD7, but with my super long and irregular cycles I haven't yet started thinking about when my fertile period will possibly arrive... Last cycle I ovulated at CD41 so... I got a huge box of Easy@Home OPKs and will start testing next week just to make sure I don't miss it, although I never got a positive OPK last cycle.</TEXT>

As for the calories in lattes, I'm not *really* looking to lose weight (I'm a perfectly healthy weight but if I could drop 5 lbs without doing anything drastic I wouldn't say no) so I wouldn't cut back just for those few calories, plus, right now I put cream so it'll probably come out almost the same :) But that's a good point for someone really wishing to lose weight!</TEXT>

I ran my first half-marathon at the end of August when we started TTC, with the naive "plan" that I'd be having a baby in the summer/fall of 2017, so I'd be off from running and return with a vengeance in 2018.. Well, that plan didn't work out so far, but in the meantime I slacked off running all fall, so here I am, starting 2017, out of shape with a body and hormones that seem to just hate me and an empty uterus.. So I've signed up for 3 races for 2017 so far (5K in May, 10K in June, and 21K in August).</TEXT>

It always feels weird at first (to me), we've been told so many times not to get pregnant by accident, but by now I just marvel at the fact that some people do get pregnant by accident, knowing how ALL the little details have to be JUST right for it to happen and to actually stick!</TEXT>

I also recommend asking your doc for blood tests as soon as you can, it's always better to start checking things out before the 6 or 12-month mark, I personally asked for bloodwork during my first cycle (which lasted 106 days btw), and was told to go back and see her in 2 months if things are still unbalanced and all...
