I've done more tasks with Servo so I'm going to be biased towards that (although imho Servo is a bit more accessible to complete beginners without any opensource experience or even git experience like me)

You can make a comment here saying you're looking for a task and say what (if any) experience you have.</TEXT>

Then if you get a task go here [Github-workflow](https://github.com/servo/servo/wiki/Github-workflow) and follow the instructions and also [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20956154/whats-the-workflow-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-using-git-pull-reque/20956155#20956155) stackoverflow answer is *extremely* helpful, I wish I found it when I started out.</TEXT>

"webrender_traits:0.11.0" = { path = 'Path/To/webrender/webrender_traits' }`

    Build as normal

Do I have to build all of Servo or can I just do `Go to the servo directory and do ./mach update-cargo -p webrender` (from the top of the README.md as well)</TEXT>

150 hours, the only thing that really pushed me was to see every location in the game so I could gauge how much genuine entertainment I could find in the game, that and I already spent 60 fucking dollars on something that was basically soul crushing to me so I might as well get my money's worth out of it.</TEXT>

The use of the term 'migrant' necessarily implies that some people have a 'right' to live in certain countries or parts of the world, whilst other people do not, based on the acceptance of mis-guided conceptions of nationality structured on 19th and 20th century fascist and absolutist rhetoric.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>

At it's core, the term 'migrant' is intrinsically racist, carrying with it the major connotation of impermanence or temporariness that implies that 'these people' will at some point 'go back to where they came from' as they are not 'natural' citizens of the area they have moved to.</TEXT>

The compiler support there is now for the like Visual Studio Code also isn't incredibly useful, I'm using RustyCode which does help but Racer seems to spend more time crashing than working and for beginner like me there was an awful lot of overhead just to get it up and running (if it even is set up right, I'm not really sure)</TEXT>

The problem i get is with the "if xx == letter..." 

    error: mismatched types: expected `char` but found `collections::string::String` (expected struct collections::string::String but found char)

After doing alot of reading in various places I've come to the conclusion that 

    let letter = reader.read_line().ok().expect("Failure");

gives me a string and going by the (somewhat confusing) error I need to somehow convert it to a char for the comparison above?</TEXT>
