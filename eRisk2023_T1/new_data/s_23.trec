            	<TEXT>Seriously speaking tho from first impressions, Formidable, Littorio, Zara, Cara and Cesare seem to be the best ones, Conte is literally worse Cesare and Trento doesn't add anything to the fleet a non-event ship doesn't but both of them are free so I see no reason why not.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Zara is a tank and with her skill will probably enjoy using HE over AP for more consistent damage again pretty necessary if you want to go full on Pizza Fleet(trademark pending) outside of those fleets she seems like she'll be dealing more damage than other tanky vanguard ships but I'm personally not sure about that just yet.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Littorio is flagship BB that deals dummy thicc damage and will steal your shipfus and honestly looking at those stats she's extremely comparable to Tirpitz and Bismarck and while I doubt she'll deal as much damage as Bismarck boosted Tirpitz I am certain she'll deal comparable damage with the correct loadout couple that with giving your vanguard and herself some torpedo protection and an actual AA stat and I think you can see why I consider her the best ship overall in this event.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_23_19_4</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Cesare's shtick is that she shoots torpedoes 10 seconds into the fight and then loses her torpedo stat and gains a percent boost to her firepower and this might be good, the damage is skill and torpedo stat based and where it hits will definitely be inconsistent but if it gets boosted by Cara's skill then it will more than likely deal quite a bit of damage.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_23_19_5</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Formidable is...probably the second best ship but I am very unsure because she is essentially an amalgam of support skills from different ships and that makes her scary but she also requires manual play for optimal usage, her skills make her enemies stop in time and she passively lowers the damage she takes and when she launches an airstrike that damage reduction spreads to the rest of the main fleet so there is definitely a lot of utility there but to get the most out of it in auto battles is going to be difficult.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>This was more long winded than I expected it to be ngl so tl;dr: Trento is basic, Cara is necessary for pizza fleet's torpedo boosting needs, Zara is THICC and might actually deal damage unlike a couple of tanky ships out there, Littorio will no doubt have comparable damage to the other high damaging BBs with as much tanking potential if not more and also helps Zara tank in pizza fleets, Cesare has skills that make you want to make her flagship until you look at Littorio and then you ask what if Cara boosted her torpedoes?</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Her stats are actually outstanding I believe she has the 3rd highest AVI stat but that's the problem, CVs dont really care as much about stats past around 400 AVI and start caring more about skills which is where Intrepid falters and not because her skills are bad but because they're not good enough when compared to the top tiers: Soaring Silver Wings activates automatically which can be awkward to use in manual but ultimately doesn't affect autoplay much, its damage is actually really good and the 100% activation chance is incredibly good, sadly it lacks focus fire which limits it to being most effective at mob clearing and not being as good at boss killing.</TEXT>
