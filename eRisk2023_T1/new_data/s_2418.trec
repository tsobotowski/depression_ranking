So if you look at with things like laws against workplace discrimination on the basis of race/gender/age, or  how so many American pharmacists run into legal problems in refusing to prescribe medications that run against their religious ideologies, as a more specific example, people who are being held accountable to these relatively new standards tend to argue the same thing and feel very strongly *their* freedom is being infringed upon, that totalitarianism is at work, when in fact these laws aim to protect the freedom of all, freedom *from* discrimination.</TEXT>

I m wondering if there is times where masturbating....is bad in terms of used as an escapism of an emotion, stress, boredom

you're kind of answering your own question: If you are aware that when you get stressed/bored you feel the need to masturbate, then you're using it as escapism.</TEXT>
