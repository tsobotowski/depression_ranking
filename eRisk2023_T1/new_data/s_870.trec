The start of Methods: 

Using claims data, we compared the prior years occurrence of vaccinations...

So, first they selected the vaccination data, then the neuropsychiatric disorders data:

...with the above neuropsychiatric disorders that were newly diagnosed between January 2002 and December 2007...

Then, control conditions were selected:

...as well as two control conditions, broken bones and open wounds...

Various factors were then also controlled for:

 Subjects were matched with controls according to age, gender, geographical area, and seasonality.</TEXT>

I think that's exactly what they did; from the Methods:

Using claims data, we compared the prior years **occurrence of vaccinations** in children and adolescents aged 615 years with the above neuropsychiatric disorders that were newly diagnosed between January 2002 and December 2007, as well as two control conditions, broken bones and open wounds.</TEXT>

 Television
Though an early critic of television, Reagan landed fewer film roles in the late 1950s and decided to join the medium.[26] He was hired as the host of General Electric Theater, a series of weekly dramas that became very popular.[26] His contract required him to tour GE plants sixteen weeks out of the year, often demanding of him fourteen speeches per day.[26] He earned approximately $125,000 per year (about $1.07 million in 2010 dollars) in this role.</TEXT>

To lodash, for OP:

 _.transform(input, (o, {id, tags}) = _.map(tags, t = o[t] = (o[t] || []).concat(id))    o)

If you can count on `tags` being an Array (and are running with JS 1.6 or newer), you can use the built-in `map`.</TEXT>
