MEGA-THREAD: MI6 agent Chris STEELE, author of history's most explosive intel dossier, will soon testify against TRUMP.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>

(1) Between 6/20/16 and 12/13/16, former MI6 agent STEELE compiled an intel dossier establishing TRUMP and allies had committed treason.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_365_3</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(2) STEELE first worked for anti-Trump GOP operatives, but most of his research was done for free due to his concern for the intel on TRUMP.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_365_4</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(3) Between 6/1 and 11/18, parts of the dossier were variously held by anti-Trump GOPers, the MI6, FBI friends of Steele, and David Corn.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_365_5</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(4) During this time--largely pre-election--there is no evidence that any of the dossier's sources had been identified or in any way harmed.</TEXT>

        </DOC>

            	<DOCNO>s_504_365_11</DOCNO>

(8) The NEW YORK FIELD OFFICE of the FBI is known to have illegally leaked confidential information to TRUMP advisers GIULIANI and PRINCE.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_365_13</DOCNO>

(9) GIULIANI and PRINCE--a TRUMP "shadow adviser" and brother to DEVOS--have admitted to having active FBI sources.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_365_14</DOCNO>

            	<DOCNO>s_504_365_15</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(11) Within seventeen days of the FBI having possession of Steele's dossier, the chief source behind the dossier had been murdered by PUTIN.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_365_16</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(12) On 12/26, the top aide and most trusted advisor of SECHIN, head of Russia's oil/gas company, was found murdered in the back of his car.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_365_17</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(13) The deceased man, former FSB agent Oleg EROVINKIN, was the trusted "go-between between SECHIN and PUTIN," also both former FSB agents.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_365_18</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(14) The dossier accused SECHIN of offering TRUMP, via PAGE, money from Russia's oil company ROSNEFT in exchange for lifting U.S. sanctions.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_365_19</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(15) The theory PUTIN helped elect TRUMP and offered money via SECHIN for lifting sanctions (allowing a ROSNEFT pipeline) is "#Russiagate."</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_365_20</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(16) The death of SECHIN aide/STEELE source EROVINKIN was reported as a heart attack before an autopsy had occurred.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_365_21</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(17) By 12/29, outlets reporting EROVINKIN died in the back of his car via heart attack were withdrawing the claim.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_365_22</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(18) While news of the death wouldn't break widely until late January, it's reasonable to assume Steele had heard about it by early January.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_365_23</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(19) The reason for this is that former FSB and ROSNEFT man EROVINKIN was--as later became public--the chief source for the STEELE dossier.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_365_24</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(20) As there was no reason for STEELE to think on 12/26 the FSB had his dossier, there was no reason for him to think EROVINKIN was killed.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_365_25</DOCNO>

(21) On 1/10, BUZZFEED published the STEELE dossier.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_504_365_27</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(22) The BUZZFEED publication also would've confirmed for STEELE that EROVINKIN had indeed been identified and thereafter murdered by PUTIN.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_365_28</DOCNO>

(23) On 1/12, STEELE and his family abandoned their home in Surrey with no indication of whether they'd ever return.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_365_29</DOCNO>

(24) By 1/12, British media had established Steele's strong reputation in the IC as former Russia-desk head for MI6.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_365_30</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(25) Meanwhile, U.S. media did little research on STEELE--and indulged claims by TRUMP that STEELE was a "failed spy" peddling "fake news."</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_365_31</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(26) By 1/27, it had been leaked that EROVINKIN, a "go-between for PUTIN and SECHIN," was a primary dossier source.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_365_32</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(27) The news of EROVINKIN being linked to the dossier within a matter of days increased the credibility of the dossier for law enforcement.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_365_33</DOCNO>

(29) On 2/27 reports placed Steele in Cambridge after 7 weeks without a sighting, though he remained away from home.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_365_35</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(30) On 3/1 it was revealed the FBI had enough confidence in the dossier that it offered to pay STEELE to expand it.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_365_36</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(31) On 3/2, SENATE DEMS contacted STEELE via friends and offered to help him testify before their Intel Committee.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_365_37</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(32) On 3/7, STEELE emerged from hiding and told the press, "I won't be making any further statements at this time."</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_365_38</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(33) A reasonable speculation is that STEELE's emergence from hiding was prompted at least in part by U.S. assurances he'd be foregrounded.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_365_39</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(34) The more attention U.S. officials gave STEELE, and the more legitimacy their statements lent to his work, the safer he was from PUTIN.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_365_40</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(35) On 3/17 it was confirmed that a STEELE source, MILLIAN, met with former MANAFORT boss (DERIPASKA) in June 2016.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_365_41</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(36) DERIPASKA, a close ally of PUTIN, had paid MANAFORT $10 million annually from 2006 to 2009 to shill for Russia.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_365_42</DOCNO>

            	<DOCNO>s_504_365_48</DOCNO>

(41) The likely Dem theory: if the dossier's content is not just public but made public by Congress, PUTIN gains nothing in killing STEELE.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_365_49</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(42) On 3/23, Rep. Himes (D-CT) of the HOUSE INTEL COMMITTEE told CBS, "Well want to talk to Christopher Steele."</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_365_50</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(43) Himes' statement confirmed the House as well as the Senate was interested in STEELE and had a new level of confidence he would testify.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_365_51</DOCNO>

(44) In the past (e.g. after the 2004 election) minority parties in Congressional committees have scheduled informal meetings for witnesses.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_365_52</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(45) So even when the GOP refuses to let STEELE formally testify, HOUSE AND SENATE DEMS can (and say they will) schedule informal testimony.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_365_53</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(46) The benefit of informal testimony is that Dems can televise the testimony so long as STEELE agrees to discuss no classified U.S. intel.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_365_54</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(47) So there's every reason to believe that (a) STEELE has strong sources, (b) PUTIN won't kill him, and (c) he will soon testify publicly.</TEXT>
        </DOC>

MEGA-THREAD: MI6 agent Chris STEELE, author of history's most explosive intel dossier, will soon testify against TRUMP.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>

(1) Between 6/20/16 and 12/13/16, former MI6 agent STEELE compiled an intel dossier establishing TRUMP and allies had committed treason.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_378_4</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(2) STEELE first worked for anti-Trump GOP operatives, but most of his research was done for free due to his concern for the intel on TRUMP.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_378_5</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(3) Between 6/1 and 11/18, parts of the dossier were variously held by anti-Trump GOPers, the MI6, FBI friends of Steele, and David Corn.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_378_6</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(4) During this time--largely pre-election--there is no evidence that any of the dossier's sources had been identified or in any way harmed.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_504_378_12</DOCNO>

(11) Within seventeen days of the FBI having possession of Steele's dossier, the chief source behind the dossier had been murdered by PUTIN.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_378_17</DOCNO>

(12) On 12/26, the top aide and most trusted advisor of SECHIN, head of Russia's oil/gas company, was found murdered in the back of his car.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_378_18</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(13) The deceased man, former FSB agent Oleg EROVINKIN, was the trusted "go-between between SECHIN and PUTIN," also both former FSB agents.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_378_19</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(14) The dossier accused SECHIN of offering TRUMP, via PAGE, money from Russia's oil company ROSNEFT in exchange for lifting U.S. sanctions.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_378_20</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(15) The theory PUTIN helped elect TRUMP and offered money via SECHIN for lifting sanctions (allowing a ROSNEFT pipeline) is "#Russiagate."</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_378_21</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(16) The death of SECHIN aide/STEELE source EROVINKIN was reported as a heart attack before an autopsy had occurred.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_378_22</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(17) By 12/29, outlets reporting EROVINKIN died in the back of his car via heart attack were withdrawing the claim.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_378_23</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(18) While news of the death wouldn't break widely until late January, it's reasonable to assume Steele had heard about it by early January.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_378_24</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(19) The reason for this is that former FSB and ROSNEFT man EROVINKIN was--as later became public--the chief source for the STEELE dossier.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_378_25</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(20) As there was no reason for STEELE to think on 12/26 the FSB had his dossier, there was no reason for him to think EROVINKIN was killed.</TEXT>

        <DOC>

(22) The BUZZFEED publication also would've confirmed for STEELE that EROVINKIN had indeed been identified and thereafter murdered by PUTIN.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_378_31</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(25) Meanwhile, U.S. media did little research on STEELE--and indulged claims by TRUMP that STEELE was a "failed spy" peddling "fake news."</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_378_32</DOCNO>

(26) By 1/27, it had been leaked that EROVINKIN, a "go-between for PUTIN and SECHIN," was a primary dossier source.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_378_33</DOCNO>

(27) The news of EROVINKIN being linked to the dossier within a matter of days increased the credibility of the dossier for law enforcement.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_504_378_34</DOCNO>

            	<DOCNO>s_504_378_36</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(30) On 3/1 it was revealed the FBI had enough confidence in the dossier that it offered to pay STEELE to expand it.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_504_378_37</DOCNO>

(31) On 3/2, SENATE DEMS contacted STEELE via friends and offered to help him testify before their Intel Committee.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_504_378_38</DOCNO>

        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_378_39</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(33) A reasonable speculation is that STEELE's emergence from hiding was prompted at least in part by U.S. assurances he'd be foregrounded.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_378_40</DOCNO>

(34) The more attention U.S. officials gave STEELE, and the more legitimacy their statements lent to his work, the safer he was from PUTIN.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_504_378_42</DOCNO>

            	<DOCNO>s_504_378_51</DOCNO>

            	<DOCNO>s_504_378_53</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(45) So even when the GOP refuses to let STEELE formally testify, HOUSE AND SENATE DEMS can (and say they will) schedule informal testimony.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_378_54</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(46) The benefit of informal testimony is that Dems can televise the testimony so long as STEELE agrees to discuss no classified U.S. intel.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_504_378_55</DOCNO>

The first incompleteness theorem states that any consistent, sufficiently powerful set of axioms is incomplete: working from those axioms, while we can prove that many propositions are true, and that many other propositions are false, there are propositions which we can neither prove true nor prove false from those axioms.</TEXT>

The proof of the first incompleteness theorem was controversial at the time, because it essentially treated what we might now consider to be "code" as what we might now consider to be "data", and very few people in the 1930s had any framework for accepting those concepts.</TEXT>
