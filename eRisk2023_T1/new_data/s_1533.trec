However, I'd argue that women's sexual desires have historically been routinely misrepresented, controlled and denied acknowledgment which have shaped cultural attitudes towards gendered sexual roles (and produced analogies such as this one).</TEXT>

However, there is now more than ample evidence to show that women are just as much sexual beings as men, who enjoy, want and look for sex, and if you can accept that then this analogy makes no sense.</TEXT>
