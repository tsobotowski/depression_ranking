------------
Cooldown: 160 / 120 / 80
Magic Damage: 175 / 350 / 525 (+ 29 / 33 / 40% of target's missing health) 

Kayle's Ulti:

Cooldown: 90 / 75 / 60

Her Q is hard to land when you first start playing her, and is easy to dodge by some champs (Ezreal, Graves, Vayne, etc)... thus making her more difficult to play than someone with a target-based stun (Taric, etc).</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> However, when you do land your Q, you deal some damage, and if you're good with quick autoattacks, you can deal just a bit more poke... 

The biggest problem I faced when playing support initially was CCing when the ADC was not able to follow up.</TEXT>
