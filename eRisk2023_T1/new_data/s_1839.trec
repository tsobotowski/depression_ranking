So in finding this, it seems like there are waaaaaay more books than I imagined, and when you suggest something like Mistborn, the following books are in the order listed about right?</TEXT>

Or is Mistborn the name given for the overall series in the sense that A Song of Ice and Fire is the title given to the series with Game of Thrones, Clash of Kings etc.</TEXT>

Also, looking at it from an outside perspective, it seems Elantris is the easiest place to start, although it may not be his best or most grand tale, and given the color scheme of suggested vs must read... The linear story setup seems to be out the window and I'm confused/overwhelmed by it.</TEXT>

So this may be rare of course because a lot of people watch at a monitor but I decided to listen to 241 on a run this week and well.. I spent 8 minutes jogging listening to guys talk about a video, in which the only thing I took from it at the time was a lot of 'ghetto shouting' and of course the pka commentary which did help a bit.</TEXT>

I just thought I'd share my mind on this matter, not sure how you guys feel, I'd like to know, but to avoid this being a full 'negative' post if you wanna call it that, I'm honestly just trying to be constructive, I have to say it was a fun episode and I can't wait for the PKA trip.</TEXT>

So who does that sit with the fact Kit Harington's contract is up until the end of 2016 and Season 6... 

His contract of course can be renewed for after it (Although this is ASOIAF) but even then, does that mean he's going to be saved in TWOW and go on with something in his plotline?</TEXT>

I understand how you feel and that talking about the differences can help review the episodes so to speak but telling us that Jaime is in the Riverlands instead of Dorne.. 

It's very nit-picky I know but because they're diverging from the book I'd like to not know what's going on there so when the season ends I'll have a new version of the story to see.</TEXT>

In saying that..
