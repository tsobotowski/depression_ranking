"there's a great book by Ken Woodward called Making Saints and it's about how the process of people becoming saints in the public consciousness has changed over the centuries and really it moved from something that was very much a local cult, because they used the term cult of the saint, and then later the Church is like "Hold on, there's a lot of people becoming saints we can't quite keep track of, we're not really sure if they're real or if they were pagans or a dog" in the case of Saint Guinefort which was a very interesting case in France where the story was, a snake had come into the Lord's baby's room, the dog killed the snake, and the Lord ran in and saw blood and the baby crying and killed the dog, and then the servant came in and realized the dog saved the baby, and they buried it and oh, the Church tells us that martyrs are saints.</TEXT>

**Troubleshooting:** I tried ramping up the fan (Turbo), but the crash occurs at a low clock speed (1.2Ghz), and with low fan usage (29%) according to GPU-Z. The temperature was 46C. After the monitor goes blank, the fans on my computer seem to ramp up really high and GPU-Z records everything as 0, except for memory usage.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>I did find out the correct answer for the bright color palette after reading Patrick Wyatt's blog:

Part of that difference can be explained by the past experiences of our artists, who had worked on several Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis console titles, where games required more dynamic colors since televisions of that era were so much worse at displaying colors than PC monitors.</TEXT>

PCPartPicker part list: http://ca.pcpartpicker.com/p/1564S

CPU: Intel Core i5-3350P 3.1GHz Quad-Core Processor  ($183.39 @ DirectCanada) 

Motherboard: ASRock H77M Micro ATX  LGA1155 Motherboard  ($74.99 @ Newegg Canada) 

Memory: G.Skill Ripjaws X Series 8GB (2 x 4GB) DDR3-1600 Memory  ($70.40 @ DirectCanada) 

Storage: Seagate Barracuda 3TB 3.5" 7200RPM Internal Hard Drive  ($129.99 @ Canada Computers) 

Case: Antec Three Hundred Illusion ATX Mid Tower Case  ($64.99 @ Newegg Canada) 

Power Supply: Antec EarthWatts Green 500W 80 PLUS Bronze Certified ATX12V / EPS12V Power Supply  ($64.99 @ NCIX) 

Optical Drive: Lite-On iHAS124-04 DVD/CD Writer  ($16.99 @ Newegg Canada) 

Total: $605.74

I'm sure it's possible to get something almost as good for under 500$. I'm guessing cheaper memory, power supply and case.</TEXT>
