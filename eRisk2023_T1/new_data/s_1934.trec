We (my girlfriend and I) are currently living in a hostel-owned house with an Italian guy and a Korean couple.</TEXT>

We've managed to explain issues of shower usage to them, so that we all can have hot showers after working on farms, but there are still little issues cropping up here and there.</TEXT>

The main two are personal property and respect - for example we got up this morning and started listening to some low-level music in the living room (quite late in the morning, so not disturbing anyone by any means); the lady of the couple came down to start cooking lunch (the kitchen/living room is one big room) and put a tv show or video on on her phone and turned up the volume loud enough to smother our music.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1934_44_5</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Similarly they put on their own music when they come down to cook or just sit in the living room and turn it up to cover our own without asking us to turn ours off or if we mind - there seems to be no form of respect or consideration in this respect.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1934_44_6</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

The other is to do with washing - we have to share our drying rack and washing line outside, and they wash their clothes without checking the availability of the drying facilities - if we have clothes out when their washing finishes, they'll pile it up on one end of the drying rack, even if its still wet, to hang theirs out instead.</TEXT>

A smaller issue is labelling - we've lived in the same house for almost two months now, and two weeks ago the Korean couple suddenly started writing their name on EVERYTHING they own food-wise.</TEXT>

First question; I've read about JoJoba, Argan and Almond oils- do these have to be specifically labelled as for beard use, or can you buy some "normal" almond oil (for example, say from the cooking oils or health foods sections) and apply a few drops of that?</TEXT>

- Defog on Charizard just isn't practical, I need another hazard remover

            	<TEXT> A generation ship (I'm not sure if that's the correct term but it's how I know of them) is a spaceship designed to hold thousands of people (or millions, maybe), and for each subsequent generation born and raised on the ship to take over running/maintenance of the ship, to enable humans as a race to a) travel farther without going faster than light (because we don't know for sure if this will ever actually work) and b) survive beyond our own planet/system.</TEXT>

What problems do you forsee that a generation ship would face (I'm thinking serious ones like radiation exposure or food supply, rather than say alien contact) and, if you can think of any, what solutions would you present?</TEXT>

I've no idea what GameFreak were thinking in generations 3/4/5 (10/13/10 legendary pokemon added respectively), but now there are a total of 46 "legendary" pokemon, most of which you can't actually get in-game without trading (or special items from events/downloads).</TEXT>

1st Gen - 4 (Total 4)
2nd Gen - 5 (Total 9)
3rd Gen - 10 (Total 19)
4th Gen - 13 (Total 32)
5th Gen - 10 (Total 42)
6th Gen - 4 (Total 46)

6th Gen looks like they've finally realised what they've been doing and reigned themselves in, but jeeze, what happened in 3rd/4th/5th!?</TEXT>

It always seemed to me that the "merged" game of the generation was the best- yellow you had pikachu running around after you (not to mention the beginnings of
The pokemon happiness elements coming in), and crystal had suicine centred around you in the story- I miss that!</TEXT>

Now I'm not up to speed- unfortunately the furthest I've played is B/W, but I like the reboot games, I just miss the extra content/alternate take on the story (like Rayquaza's more central role in Emerald).</TEXT>
