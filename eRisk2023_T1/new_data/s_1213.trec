No, you have **claimed** it as unlikely, you have also claimed you are a "one eyed pirate", It is a simple fact that a person going about on shipboard or involved in any kind of fight is not going to cover one eye and lose not only depth perception but also cut back on their range of vision, a person would cut off a thirty degree arc of their vision by covering one eye and that is not going to happen.</TEXT>

 Can you explain why, if there was some advantage to be gained by wearing an eye patch during naval combat that only pirates would be doing it and not regular navy as well as armed merchant vessels defending themselves from attack?</TEXT>

The entire idea is based on the assumption that a pirate engaged in a fight would be continuously moving from the open deck to the darkest below decks.</TEXT>

 I understand that fight is controversial to say the least among people who do not participate but in nature, for many animals fighting and aggression are an imperative fact of life, roosters have a very short list of things they want to do today and fighting is pretty much at the top of that list  and what the cockfighter does is hardly worse than what a man who hunts with a hawk or a bow or a man who fishes with a hook does and these are thought socially acceptable and respectable by most.</TEXT>
