- Until Dawn: Rush of Blood
- RIGS
- Batman
- Resident Evil 7 

( being games I consider must own)

**Good Games**
- Battlefront VR Mission (if you already have the game)
- EVE Valkyrie (multiplayer)
- Battlezone
- The Brookhaven Experiment
- Dirt VR
- Job Simulator 
- Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes (if you have local friends)

There are many, many more games and experiences available, but these I would say are the best value for money (for me).</TEXT>

Final Fantasy X-2
Dreamfall
Mirrors Edge

This doesn't mean I don't value expert opinion as of course someone like you who's spent their life researching something is liable to know more about it than me, but to use your own analogy, it would be like a mathematician telling me 2x2 is 4 when an error here could alter the course of someone's life, and me wanting to verify that information with external sources and similar cases as people can and have made mistakes in the past.</TEXT>

The point i'm making isn't that people should not trust doctors, only that before undertaking **any** medical treatment, they should also check out the possible side effects and then once they've checked themselves (and educated themselves on that drug and it's pitfalls) can they then make an informed decision.</TEXT>

- PSVR

- Pokmon Sun and Moon
- Final Fantasy XV

- Dishonoured 2
- Skyrim Special Edition

To be honest I would have hoped they push TF2 back to January or even February just due to product saturation.</TEXT>

Even if it had been custom cut by the manufacturer (companies like Karndean can, but they will do this for a premium), the end user probably put the wood strip next to it as an afterthought as if it had been discussed with the manufacturer how they were planning to do it, the hexagons could have been cut ever so slightly smaller to suit.</TEXT>

This goes for melee too, i've swung at an opponent three times before they spin around and one shot me, and then the death stat readout says the enemy has loads of health (last one I had was 86%) when I clearly hit the enemy at least twice (they started moving on the third swing).</TEXT>

I've fairly recently been listening to lots of Carpenter Bru, Perturbator, Vangelis, MegaDrive and others, but aside from lucking out on youtube and finding videos, and the odd game or movie that has that kind of soundtrack (Hotline Miami, Drive), where can I find more music like this, or can you recommend any other artists for me to listen to?</TEXT>

The drawbacks to this is the small amount players that "cashed out" in the last few says will be super rich in a few months if they hold onto their gold, and the larger amount of people who thought they had 1000's of gold worth of items in their bank, but just had that price crash.</TEXT>
