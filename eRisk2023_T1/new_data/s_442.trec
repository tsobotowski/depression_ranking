Getting back to my example above, if you are correct and P(awake|T)=1, then P(T|awake,Monday) (she is told that it's Monday) must be (by Bayes)

P(T|awake,Monday)=P(awake,Monday|T)P(T)/P(awake,Monday)

=P(awake,Monday|T)(.5)/P(awake,Monday)

Now, P(awake,Monday) should equal P(Monday), and that's 3/4 under your theory (1*.5 for H, and .5*.5 for T)

so

P(T|awake,Monday)=P(awake,Monday|T)(.5)/(3/4)

Now, P(awake,Monday|T) should be 1/2, so plugging that in

P(T|awake,Monday)=(1/2)(1/2)/(3/4)=**1/3**

This means that learning that it's Monday causes SB to think that the coin was tails only 33% of the time, and is a direct consequence of your view.</TEXT>

Some other things to factor in: maybe we should calculate (number of people hearing X)/(number of people believing X), to adjust for more people believing things that more people have heard of; you should also adjust in the other direction for correlation between popularity as opposed to belief, and truth.</TEXT>

In the end, I think other methods of finding truth are far more efficient; finding out how many people believe something requires you to do a survey, and if it's already been done, then chances are there's enough info about the topic to make a judgement anyway.</TEXT>

You also need to make sure you don't double-count this evidence; if people's beliefs are based on arguments, then conditioning on those arguments partly screens off those beliefs, and it's probably really hard to properly adjust for that.</TEXT>

If it is true that they can solve NP-complete problems in polymnomial time, it would be trivial to prove it; just release all the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_numbers

The "problems" with their machine are not fixable, they're fundamental to the problem they're trying to solve.</TEXT>

On December 16, 2005, The New York Times reported that, under White House pressure and with an executive order from President George W. Bush, the National Security Agency, in an attempt to thwart terrorism, had been tapping phone calls made to persons outside the country, without obtaining warrants from the United States Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, a secret court created for that purpose under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).[216]

One such surveillance program, authorized by the U.S. Signals Intelligence Directive 18 of President George Bush, was the Highlander Project undertaken for the National Security Agency by the U.S. Army 513th Military Intelligence Brigade.</TEXT>

Look, private schools are definitely not spending *all* the money on religious stuff, or they'd get much lower marks in standardised tests, which [doesn't happen](http://nces.ed.gov/nationsreportcard/pubs/studies/2006461.asp)

If it costs a public school X to provide an education, and a private school can provide religious education *and* non-religious education and do as good as the public schools in standardised tests, then the private school is providing at least X in value per kid.</TEXT>

In 2014, about 136.78 billion gallons (or 3.26 billion barrels) of gasoline were consumed in the United States, a daily average of about 374.74 million gallons (or 8.92 million barrels)

So 240 million gallons less would be 136.54 billion, a reduction of less than .2%.</TEXT>

 In France for example they have "Loi Macron" that forbids such thing

As far as I can see this Loi Macron is something passed recently, within the last few months, for example http://www.thelocal.fr/20150410/france-gifted-but-lazy-loafing-pierre-gattaz and http://www.afrizap.com/en/france/. So it seems irrelevant, unless I'm missing something.</TEXT>

* xlsx
* pdf
* txt
* docx

First, we get this right in the beginning:

Ad-free mirror of the text;

clearly implying that the entire text is inside a mirror (see document 297-T-REDACTED for further elaboration on this).</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_442_1315_6</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Second, we see in the intro what appears to be an obvious DATA EXPUNGED:

 This is a rationalist story;

Rationalist comes from ancient Latin from mirror.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_442_1315_7</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>In fact, if you search google for Rationalist mirror, [hpmor comes up](https://archive.today/KzShE).</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_442_1315_8</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>But this might not be conclusive, because of REDACTED and REDACTED.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_442_1315_9</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Third, we get in Chapter 6 the following

There was an abstracted look on her face (almost exactly the same look that had appeared on Harry's own face while experimenting on the pouch, if Harry had only seen himself in a mirror to realise that).</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_442_1315_10</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

This is obviously foreshadowing DATA EXPUNGED and DATA EXPUNGED, as well as providing strong evidence that people are stuck in a mirror and can't see through it.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_442_1315_11</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>


Fourth, there is the widely talked about DATA EXPUNGED from Chapter 6

As his hand touched the back door's handle, he heard a last whisper from behind him.</TEXT>

        <DOC>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_442_1315_15</DOCNO>

            	<DOCNO>s_442_1315_16</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_442_1315_17</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

This strongly implies that Professor REDACTED was left out of the DATA EXPUNGED, for reasons too obvious to detail.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_442_1315_18</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Further on, we observe (Chapter 10)

I am in essence a sort of mirror with which to trap children

possibly the most explicit confession in-story to date, with the possible exception of DATA EXPUNGED

Then we get to 27

The Weasley twins had tested their new monocles on the "forbidden" third-floor corridor, making a quick trip to the magic mirror, but when they tried to go back, they'd realized they were stuck forever.</TEXT>

Next, let's look at chapter 54

Thirty seconds later Harry was the proud new owner of a curved mirror, and quickly walked into it (which confused his mind for a bit, before he got distracted by whatever he wanted).</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_442_1315_31</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

And

The mirror lay alive and vibrant in his hand.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_442_1315_32</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

And

his mirror was perfect

This confirms that it infected Harry early on, but in case you're uncertain see 63:

 Harry had been infected by the mirror for as long as he could remember

Now, one thing we *haven't* confirmed is whether Hermione is in the REDACTED.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_442_1315_33</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Chapter 72:

Hermione reached into her robes, and drew out a little rod with a mirror on the end of it and an eyepiece.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_442_1315_34</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>The mirror quickly took over her body and mind, leaving her in eternel bliss.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_442_1315_35</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Plus this bit of REDACTED from 77:

Hermione hadn't tried walking past a mirror yet, she wasn't sure she wanted to.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_442_1315_36</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Plus a little later in 84 we get confirmation that the mirror is responsible for Hermione dying:

The mirror cut off abruptly.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_442_1315_37</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Susan, 73:

For an instant, she glowed in a strange mirror-color, like a reflection of herself, until the mirror swallowed her whole

Tracey, 74:

Well, I'm pretty sure I did," said Tracey, sounding briefly uncertain before she rallied. "</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_442_1315_38</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>I mean, I looked at myself in a mirror and I look paler and can make my wishes come true now, and I can always feel darkness surrounding me, and I was a conduit for his dread powers and everything...

Pansy, 74:

        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_442_1315_39</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Now we know where it came from, who it infected, DATA EXPUNGED and REDACTED, but who has it now?</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_442_1315_40</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Let's look at 82:

Terrible and stern stood the ancient wizard, like he was carven from stone; beard woven of thread like iron, half-moon glasses like mirrors, and the pupils behind as sharp and unyielding as black diamond.</TEXT>
        </DOC>

            	<DOCNO>s_442_1315_41</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

So there *was* a pair of glasses that [wasn't just that](https://www.reddit.com/r/HPMOR/comments/2x4lxu/im_way_better_at_having_bad_ideas_than_good_ones/), after all.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_442_1315_42</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Now, there's also a piece of evidence suggesting that DATA EXPUNGED, as well as proving that the REDACTED can hold multiple people at once (84):

The mirror transmitted a sound of muffled laughter in the background, sounding like it was coming from more than one person.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_442_1315_43</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Let's skip to 100:

The mirror was in Draco's hand, and it remained lifeless as his finger mechanically tapped at the surface, over and over.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_442_1315_44</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

This is definite foreshadowing of the mirror breaking at some future point, which is consistent with information gotten from REDACTED.</TEXT>
