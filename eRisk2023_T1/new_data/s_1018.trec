LONDON, 10 May, 2017  US scientists who have been warning that warmer oceans are more likely to be poorer in dissolved oxygen have now sounded the alarm: ocean oxygen levels are indeed falling, and seemingly falling faster than the corresponding rise in water temperature.</TEXT>

That colder water can hold more dissolved gas than warmer water is a commonplace of physics: it is one reason why polar seas are teeming with marine life and tropical oceans are blue, clear and often relatively impoverished.</TEXT>

cheron is the person who ferries the boat across the River Styx, and Cerberus is the three headed dog that guards the gates of hell

mot is probably a play on the word maat, the Egyptian concept ofbalance order and harmony

            	<TEXT>all the rhetoric about "freedom , democracy,  patriotism, fighting for the oppressed, blah blah blah" is just what governments have to say to motivate their citizens to go murder citizens in other nations

And Sunni versus Shia is really Saudi Arabia  (backed by the West/US) and their allies versus Iran and their allies

So once you see the Syrian conflict in this lens it makes much more sense.</TEXT>

From 1969 to 1973, the RCC introduced social welfare programs funded with oil money, which led to house-building projects and improved healthcare and education.[75] In doing so, they greatly expanded the public sector, providing employment for thousands.[75]

Compulsory education was expanded from 6 to 9 years old, while adult literacy programs and free university education were implemented; Beida University was founded, while Tripoli University and Benghazi University were expanded.[76] These early social programs proved popular within Libya.[77]

Until the 1960s, most scientists argued that ball lightning was not a real phenomenon but an urban myth, despite numerous reports from throughout the world.[3] Laboratory experiments can produce effects that are visually similar to reports of ball lightning, but how these relate to the natural phenomenon remains unclear.</TEXT>

If you look at the Wikipedia entry for assassins, they make a strong case that the word is actually derived from the word hashish

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassins#Etymology[1]

But then it seems to contradict itself later on with this quote from a historian

The truth is different.</TEXT>

So I found this study, which amasses data from many different studies  to detail exactly what is lost to ejaculation

http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2164/jandrol.04104/full


Note that its expressed in terms of  mg/100 mL. In other words you lose X mg of nutrient Y per 100 mL of semen.</TEXT>

Suddenly it turns back towards the city of Monterey, accelerates REALLY quickly with absolutely no noise whatsoever, swoops down and flies over the entire city of Monterey, turns back over the ocean, flies out  over the middle of Monterey Bay, and then

And here's where it gets freaky

It flies INTO the ocean.</TEXT>

After 31 months, they found that compared to the homes which still used table salt (NaCl) in their kitchens, in the homes where a salt mixture with equal amounts of potassium and sodium had been substituted for NaCl, there was a statistically significant:

39% drop in cardiovascular disease
70% decrease in heart failure
50% decrease in cerebral vascular disease
and a 25% drop (though not statistically significant) in diabetes (which I had predicted in the 1980s).</TEXT>
