            	<TEXT>TWG's website just recently came online so I have not checked their shipping price but their price is over 40US for 50g online (I think 25US in Singapore's airport), where T2Tea was 45 US to ship 4 50g bags but their tea was only 18 for 50g.  I've since tried about 30 Yunnan's looking for their flavor, with very limited success.</TEXT>
