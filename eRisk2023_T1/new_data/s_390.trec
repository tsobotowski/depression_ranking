As for me, I am used to collapsing system initialization into a small script where everything is basically hard-coded, for lack of a better term, with full paths to executeables and in a sequential order that makes sense from a hardware point of view (look at multipathing over a distributed filesystem, for example).</TEXT>

It's a practice I implemented at this particular place because they wanted those machines to be able to reboot in 20 seconds, so I ripped out everything that we didn't need, packed up our own RPMS, and it all worked relatively smoothly until systemd came along.</TEXT>

So yeah, it was my fault, and I'll take a seat at the anti-systemd camp anyway because having such a seemingly fundamental change in the workflow of manipulating services on these machines was not something anyone could foresee when we dove in to begin with.</TEXT>

To observe a 4th dimension entity from within the 3rd would require applying 4th dimension physics to the 3rd, thus the possibility of leaving everything in the universe in all possible states in a single existence.</TEXT>

What I guess I'm thinking is that you'd at some point have to break the laws of physics for a given dimension in order to observe an entity from a higher dimension, and without any education whatsoever to back this up, it doesn't seem like you can break just one law of physics, if any can be broken at all.</TEXT>

But then, the 3rd dimension is simply a set of instructions for creating the 4th, which leads me to another question.. how can the 4th dimension exist at all (in the sense that it includes all of time as well) if time has not yet ended?</TEXT>

This sounds like the 4th dimension is *being* built, our perception of that process is our existence in the 3rd, and the 4th cannot ever be observed until *all* of time has past in the universe.</TEXT>

This is all, of course, if you are subscribing to the notion that the 4th dimension utilizes what we percieve as time as a spatial vector, in which case it's a little easier to picture the 4th dimension as any one of infinite alternative universes that exist in parallel to our own.</TEXT>

Now it just sounds like the 4th dimension is just a collection of 3-D universes and all of the time measurable within them... except in the 4th, one can travel back in time, playing the interaction of mass and energy in reverse, thus eventually creating a huge ball of mass/energy that would eventually implode under it's own weight, perhaps similar in appearance to the way a star does, into whatever instance of existence the big bang itself emerged from.</TEXT>

You cans see, I've rearranged the sentence structure by using different conjugations/forms of the same words to transpose subject and predicate (for arguments sake) while trying to maintain the original impact the words had on me, but the way you tie it together at the end is what it's about and very difficult to mutate and impossible for me to imitate.</TEXT>

Dear zit on my ass  
Won't you go away  
I found you in the shower  
While bathing myself today  


Zit on my ass  
Please leave me alone  
I feel like that girl  
I call on the phone  


Zit on my ass  
Why are you still there  
I feel like I hate you  
And I want to stare  


Zit on my ass  
Please leave me be  
How I have told you  
She doesn't want me  


Zit on my ass..  
How I wish I could  
Sit a normal position  
As normal ass should  


Sit on my ass  
That's why you're there  
Because I am lazy  
Because I don't care  


Zit on my ass..   </TEXT>

especially when we like many of the same things

even when we agree to disagree in between

we both see its not easy being green

and when its time to come clean

when our qualities are redeemed

admitting what our dreams really mean

it's like nothing before ever believed or seen

when someone special is indeed what they seem

Your memory rises out of thick black ash

Fatal attraction, where rock and life crash

A scorned lover thrown from a cold windy cliff

Carrying your body and blood out to sea
