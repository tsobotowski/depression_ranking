            	<TEXT>(Cut and pasted from another DW post): It's good to have an all-comers list, but the great thing about Deathwatch is the flexibility, and there's no better way of achieving that than by magnetising the arms.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Deathwatch with magnetised arms gives you a huge range of options (Also if you have a spare back and legs grab the Deathwatch Upgrade pack, it'll give you enough DW pads for all the left arms and a head and chest for another model, bringing you up to about 16 pairs of arms and 6 bodies).</TEXT>
