To dredge up an old analogy from the 2008 crash, if I owned some sick cows and the Fed announced that it would give me a healthy cow for every sick cow I handed over to them, that would be an equal-valued swap in your book, because I could also sell my sick cows to other institutions on the open market for a healthy cow, since those other institutions know they could turn their sick cows in to the Fed for a healthy one.</TEXT>

The textbook said to solve this using Poisson and P(x4) for a mean of 3.9 - I don't think this is valid since the probability of getting more than four strokes on any given hole cannot be equated to *averaging* more than 4 strokes over the course of 18 holes, because of the Law of Large Numbers.</TEXT>

I've read some criticism of Campbell that claimed he was proto-Fascist for reducing all of human culture to the struggle of the Hero, I think that's going too far, but it could be that he was too wedded to his idea of the Monomyth to see the dialectical possibility in the Hero breaking out of it.</TEXT>

That reminds me of something I once heard or read that there were certain schismatic Anabaptist groups that went out into the backwoods - if you were in one of these groups, you wouldn't get a "Christian" name until you were formally baptized into the church, and even some adults were not given that privilege (perhaps they had misbehaved or offended the church leaders), so they were just called "man" or something like that for their entire lives.</TEXT>

Without boring you with an entire manifesto, my "anti-Formalist" view is that formal systems cannot provide a complete description of reality, that logic always needs to refer to a non-logical "ground" in order to avoid contradiction, and therefore there is always a gap between a formal description of reality and the Real itself, and that consciousness lives, at least in part, in this gap.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> I was just pointing out that many famous scientists have believed in or theorized about a connection between *biology* and QM, and if we accept that consciousness is a biological process at least on some level, then there may indeed be a QM component to consciousness, just as there is in other biological systems.</TEXT>

You might think the links between quantum effects and cell biology are "nothing special," but until recently biology was thought to be explainable in wholly classical terms, except by some visionaries like Schrdinger,  and now we know that's not true.</TEXT>

You are right that Gdel was a Platonist, and also right he didn't think that the link between his Theorems and consciousness was related to QM, but you were rubbishing that idea as well, so I thought I'd admit where I stand on that issue as well.</TEXT>

I am "agnostic" on this link in a strictly scientific-method sense, but in a broader philosophical context, due to what I see as weaknesses in traditional naturalism, yet as someone unwilling to accept dualism or a purely "mystical" explanation for consciousness, the link to quantum processes seems suggestive, though not conclusive.</TEXT>

I'm starting to suspect that qualia might indeed exist, and only be *mediated* by language, which can open or foreclose access to them depending on the grammar, and not created as an illusion of language, and the reason there's no sharp cutoff between "redness" and "orangeness" is because there's just one color qualia that exists as a continuum.</TEXT>

I'm pretty skeptical about qualia myself, both internal and external, but the one phenomenon I don't think has been explained is the simultaneity of distinct objects of visual perception, and that one thread kind of lets everything else in again through the back door.</TEXT>

It's not enough to say that vision merely *appears* simultaneous, obviously it's not and many studies have proven this (including the infamous "gorilla" experiment), because it's appearances that are the issue.</TEXT>

I have an admittedly crazy theory that there are two dimensions of time, the other one curled up around our familiar dimension like the extra dimensions of String Theory, and that the unity of visual perception is processed in that dimension, using some Penrose-style quantum woo-woo hand-waving, and then somehow "presented" back to the ordinary mind as a unity.</TEXT>

So if you don't think I'm entirely bonkers after hearing that, I'd love to hear any further thoughts you might have on the subject, given that even formidable minds have said what we should do with this issue is just "sweep it aside and hope for the best"

I do think the Churchlands are far more radical than the rather uncontroversial critique you ascribe to them: In my reading of their position, they think "love" refers to not many different states, but to *nothing* - that the behaviors we ascribe to "love" have *no affective states behind them whatsoever*, any more than there is some being called Zeus behind the phenomenon of thunder.</TEXT>
