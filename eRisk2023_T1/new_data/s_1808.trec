You mentioned lack of support from parents, and I think that may play a role in this

My parents didn't abuse me, and they did provide me with the essentials and more, such as Christmas presents or sometimes helping me pay for college, but they were always overtly strict and critical, and yelled a lot

I'm also afraid of coming to them for any advice because I'm afraid of them being critical of me, and for the many reasons I will mention below.</TEXT>
