-Female circumcision removes the clitoris, which would be like removing the entire penis in a male

-Female circ is only performed to diminish sexual stimulation in the female

-Female circ is done in dirty conditions with pieces of class, inviting infection and death

-Female circ ruins lives

I don't deny all this is true in certain parts of the world, like a lot of countries in Africa.</TEXT>
