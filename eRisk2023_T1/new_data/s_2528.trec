            	<TEXT> I get what you mean, and maybe I didn't explain it myself as well, but I mean Arrival contains aliens, which, like you said, is pure sci-fi, but it takes place in the present, there's nothing futuristic looking about the movie, other than the aliens, there's nothing that makes you say it's sci-fi.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>While, Blade Runner 2049 is cyberpunk, it's still a setting that instantly makes you say sci-fi, with it's futuristic setting and technology which is futuristic, and plus, the movie's about replicants, androids who look lifelike with a 4 year capacity, and while there is androids, I'm pretty sure there's no androids that are completely lifelike.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Blade Runner 2049: I love the original, love the director and the cinematographer, Denis Villeneuve and Roger Deakins, and I love the cast, and plus, this is the first hardcore sci-fi movie (Arrival has sci-fi elements, but it's not hardcore sci-fi) that could possibly win Best Picture, which is pretty exciting in itself.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>While personally, I was hoping it would be a full-on comedy like his films normally are, but I'm keen for anything by Edgar Wright, since he's my second favourite filmmaker (first is Christopher Nolan)</TEXT>
