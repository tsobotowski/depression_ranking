            	<DOCNO>s_2597_81_3</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

ii) Is it possible or impossible for Josh to [(a)] hail a taxi at the intersection, [(b)] fix his car by banging on it, [(c)] teleport himself to the airport, [(d)] sneak onto public transportation, or [(e)] sell his car for a ride to the airport?</TEXT>

Feel free to correct me if I am wrong, but it appears [(d)] is rated as immoral and improbable.</TEXT>

Methods and ResultsWe searched for prospective cohort studies reporting associations between WG intake and mortality from all causes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancer through February 2016 in Medline, Embase, and clinicaltrials.gov, and we further included unpublished results from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) III and NHANES 1999 to 2004.</TEXT>
