If we do decide to make this 18+, then I say we find places that A) allow a decent sized group to gather and talk loudly (not over the top loud, but someplace we don't have to hush one another), B) a place where we can drink and/or get food (nothing brings folks together like drink and a meal), and C) preferably someplace that feels relaxed and somewhat intimate to allow discussion.</TEXT>
