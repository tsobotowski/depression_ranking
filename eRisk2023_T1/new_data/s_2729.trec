            	<TEXT>Im currently at 26/30 traits for the trophy and this is one of the traits im missing, i've seen many people say it takes 100 kills with 10 different weapons to get, but i've seen just as many say they got it (relatively) early in the game or got it using only 4 weapons, and many say that even after getting all kills they did not get the trait.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Edit: Forgot to reply to the "What game hold in high regard" bit, as it is a ND game, im comparing it to their previous works, their games usually have superb storytelling and writing, but here it just, feels like they made the game dark for the sake of it being dark, characters get killed and no one reacts all the time, its like they never existed, the story could have been told in a much more consistent way (as i said above) and the quality of the dialogue (writing, not voice acting) lacks every now and then.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>So first of all, i understand that this game is not supposed to play like an action RPG (even tho thats what it tries to look like), at first i was straight up having an awful time with combat until i realized that, and ngl after fixing my approcah I improved a bit, but its still not enough.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>I've found that boss encounters (specifically the ones that require you to use a certain character to fight appropiately), are an enormous loop of charge your ATB enough to do something - gt; Try to do something - gt; get interrupted and lose your MB, ATB and HP - gt; switch characters to distract the boss for around 3 seconds while you try again with the character that is actually useful- gt; stagger - gt; repeat Spells are extremely easy to miss, specially on flying targets (even tho you're supposed to use spells on those), and not to mention that stronger spells take a whole lot of time to cast and just hope that your enemy doesnt move an inch so you can land it, and even if you land it, gotta wait for it to actually blow up (looking at you blizzard/blizzara/blizzaga) My main issue is that even tho this game is supposed to work with a party system, it doesnt.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Take Dragon Age for example, your party usually can handle itself pretty good on their own and you can set them up to use specific spells or abilities when they want, here tho, if you dont directly take control of each character, they're not gonna do anything but run around and take some dmg, they barely even charge ATB on their own, and the enemies focus HARD on whoever you're controlling unless you switch mid ability.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_2729_652_6</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>After that you should get your max stats personas of choice (I suggest Yoshitsune for obvious reasons, when you have agility maxed out, 8/10 hits will be a critical if you also use heat riser or any skill that boosts agility, combine that with knockdown style which Yoshitsune naturally has and you get yourself an easy carry all the way to merciless) Lastly, if you have already done all of that and still come up short of lvl 75, you should know that after you beat the final boss you unlock several new requests including the Metatron fight and a new set of Painful Past requests with higher difficulties.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Pd: You most likely wont reach lvl 99 in the first playthrough unless you grind the living hell out of the Metatron boss fight, so i suggest you get to lvl 83-85, complete the "Knocking on Death's door" request and go into Merciless like that, its a lot faster to get those last 15 lvls in merciless and it wont be too difficult as you have 99 in all stats regardless of not being lvl 99 yourself.</TEXT>
