However, I have come across a number of fellow Chinese singaporeans making comments like "not that I am racist but Malays are lazier"...(context: when recruiting people I have met HR people and hiring managers that judge Malays just for being Malays even before the interview)

I get very upset at such statements, especially coming from otherwise seemingly civilised "nice" people.</TEXT>

Also, I find that certain nuances in speech get lost in text messages so if you don't know each other well enough yet, some of the stuff you're trying to say won't come across to her the way you meant it, and vice versa.</TEXT>
