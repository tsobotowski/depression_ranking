I personally think that they started experimenting more with electronic sounds more because of Pennie (dude has a degree from Berklee in Music Production, I believe), which has helped their Afterman sound be what it is, but I think YOTB as a whole was such a drastic "experimental" turn from previous records that most Coheed fans wrote it off.</TEXT>
