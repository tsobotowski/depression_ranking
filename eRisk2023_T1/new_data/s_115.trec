            	<TEXT>As a community leader, it is my intention to be welcoming and maintain good relationships with pool operators, I have received lots of messages from these operators asking for "fair exposure", and I don't blame them - I want to provide fair exposure to staking pools, but I can't, in good conscience, encourage users to participate in a pool that I wouldn't use.</TEXT>
