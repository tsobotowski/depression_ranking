I just finished reading the majority and the dissents and in one of the dissents, I think it was Scalia's, the author says that by interpreting the 14th Amendment as granting the rights of gay marriage, the majority is contending that they see something that every past SCOTUS justice has missed in the past and how insulting it is to those past great justices.</TEXT>

Therefore, I believe you are correct in saying that because the states believe they have the rights to regulate marriage from the 10th Amendment, but SCOTUS has stepped in and said that when there is an infringement of civil rights, the 14th rules.</TEXT>

3) Thus, the reason we say don't vote third party is because we don't want people to encourage others to vote third party because then we may end up with the least desirable candidate winning.</TEXT>

4) So even if you live in a non-swing state, you shouldn't encourage others to vote third party because it may turn your state into a swing state if you have enough sway, or if you make a few people decide to vote third and they in turn make people decide to vote third in the next election and so on, until your state that would have been a safe state is now a swing state a few elections down the road.</TEXT>

PAYE works by:

1) taking your salary
2) then subtracting 1.5 times the poverty line, now $17,500
3) then you pay 10% of the amount left each year (divide by 12 for monthly payment)

If your income was $30,000 for example, you would pay $104 per month MAXIMUM.</TEXT>

Lets say they bought the house for $100K, taking a loan for $90K

In that scenario, and the numbers in real life might be worse or better for your boyfriend's family, the bank would be able to sell the home and PROFIT $120K. They would be insane to renegotiate any loan when they could profit by letting the home go to foreclosure.</TEXT>
