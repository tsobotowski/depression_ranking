            	<TEXT>I didn't have any friend until last year because of this, I thought I was depressed because I didn't socialize, so I made very good friends with people started hanging out doing "normal" stuff to improve my well being, I tried following a routine getting at least 8 hours of sleep, waking up early getting some sun exposure heck I even tried keeping my self busy with work, I meditate I also started antidepressants to help myself I took lexapro 10mg for about an year that didn't seem to help very much, it helped with my anxiety a bit but it made me feel like a zombie, it made my emotions dull but didn't help with depression, it made my dreams vivid and sleep worse, some days it would make me super sleepy to the point where it was impossible to keep awake to do my work done, some days it would make me sleepless.</TEXT>
