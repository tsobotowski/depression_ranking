            	<TEXT> Yeah - but that goes with pecking orders - a lack of structure and heirarchy, but then again, dissenters always pop up in any movement, and I've seen all the in-fighting between feminist rhethoric of "real feminist have curves" vs. "real feminists love their bodies no matter what" or choice feminist vs. total feminist or more "important matters" and I'm right and you're wrong and all the pointless back and forth of it all - but it still remains shallow and irrelevant because as far as the text book definition of feminism goes that most people are fine with, we surpassed that long ago.</TEXT>

I guess this goes in line with what I said in this same post about subverting the traditional narrative:  you don't get the simple satisfaction of *beginning - middle - end, good (or bad) guys saves the day, and somebody wins,* and you are left with a few moments of satisfaction in between a sea of too many story-lines, favorite character's deaths, and a book-series that might never be finished, but again, that rests on the reader or viewer's opinions :D</TEXT>

The point is, what we get are few moments of satisfaction in between a lot of frustration, character deaths, and annoying story-arcs that either go on too long, or peter out with little fanfare (Stanis), or aren't given enough development and focus, but those opinions are all up to the reader and/or viewer.</TEXT>

Whenever my hunter is grabbed by a brain sucker or snake man or garden of eyes, I go outside for a smoke, take a dump, watch the news, make dinner, and then I usually get back just in time as the brainsucker is done sucking out my insight, and then my character lays down for a nap, and is ready to finally stand back up and continue the fight :D

            	<TEXT>There are like, four or five builds in this game, but I really do hate people who spam shotguns from max range, effectively rooting themselves and flinching me...for no reason, and I do hate eveylyn spammers too, but I digress :P


Honestly,  between the limited weapon options and lack of builds, I don't find this game's gestures to be as insulting as previous games, and with our 20 second/2-3 shot PvP meta, it's hard for me to take this game's PvP as seriously (Fighting super tryhard havel/butthole/jester/assclowns duel wielding katanas shooting crystal soul spears who then do a /mock gesture is a whole different story).</TEXT>

The other night I was in hizngr and I fought this one chikevelyn guy (most of them usually are), but he was good, and I just couldn't get him, and he'd always kill me in two transformed hits, with or without a few bullet holes.</TEXT>

Stats/Sacrafice - Again, this has everything to do with why I am asking people to stop treating this game's PvP and builds the same as FROM's previous titles, because in the past, again, sacrafice was important and thus relevant, but the gains in damage from stats are so minor at present (due to the gems), that the arguments for a lower meta wind up sounding ridiculous, and there is no real reson for it.</TEXT>

So you, and every other stubborn person can continue to say *"but if I have a lot of two stats, it will somehow ruin PvP and make my character a jack of all trades",* and I will continue to say *bullshit,* because stats aren't the problem in this game, gems are, and the 20 second/2-3 shot meta of PvP is a fucking joke anyhow.</TEXT>

Going deeper with it: opening up more weapon options on a toon is fun, and the fact that we only have five builds (with a 75-120 meta) and a handful of weapons in this game does not make for the most dynamic PvP, so if you have more options on any character, I see that as a good thing (and this is coming from someone who has around 7 or 8 toons with 4 or 5 different builds each, most of which who have run through all the chalices and are fit for PvP).</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>


Again, this became redundant awhile ago, but the arguments for the arbitrary lower meta are sounding more and more ridiculous, stubborn, and dated to me, and other than arguments that were relevant to past SOULS games, I think they have no place in Bloodborne.</TEXT>

They should have just converted the summon/dueling signs into messenger bells, where, instead of writing your sign on the ground, your messengers sit there ringing the bells for you, but they operate the same exact way the summon signs did, that way they could have kept the effectiveness of the summon signs, and stayed true to the aesthethic of Bloodborne.</TEXT>

A higher meta gives us more survivability and more build options, and these have been lacking in standard meta Bloodborne PvP.  As for trying to treat this game like DaS3, let's look at what we left behind, and what the argument for a lower meta always fails to address:

Weapons - We have very few choices, and even less choices when you consider the many who flock to to stay competitive by using the two most easy to OP weapons in the game (LHB and Chikage+eve).</TEXT>

Competition and game mechanics:  This goes back to what I've mentioned before and putting it all together:  We have ninja builds with no armor/weight options, no survivability buffs, less HP than ever before (especially when you are the invader), little build variety, and weapons that are easy to make ridiculously powerful, and thus the low level meta is a two to three shot, 20 to 30 seconds PvP match.</TEXT>

As for myself, I've come to prefer matches with healing, as they last longer than 20 or 30 seconds, and are more enjoyable and make for more thrilling fights, and with how slow and clunky multi-player can be, it becomes even more relevant.</TEXT>

Edit:  I'd like to add that the two to three shot meta is also kind of frustrating, as your latency test for the other player can put you one swing away from death, and leaves little to no room for experimentation and lag.</TEXT>

Edit:  And while there is the curious love-craftian mechanic of insight vs. madness, it isn't as fleshed out as it could of or should have been, but at least this is one of the few love-craftian games out there with an actual Lovecraft mechanic in it (so many games miss out on this awesome opportunity).</TEXT>

I can sort of see from a design view, since there were so few weapons, they wanted to make them more customizable, but RNG gem farming (or any farming for that matter) isn't the best game design or use of a player's time imo.</TEXT>

Besides, there are only four builds in this game (five if we include quality as a build in itself, which we can and should), but aside pure lower level builds, a lot of builds still dip into secondary stats anyhow (Ie, STR usually has some SKL, BT usually has some SKL for untransformed chikage, etc), so it's not like we are going overboard anyhow, or making our toons be masters at everything.</TEXT>

We know the story pretty much started with the discoveries at Byrgynwyrth, and the split came when Laurence left to pursue the power of blood (and founded the church), but the issue I have is that I see everyone talk about it as if Laurence set up a church in Yharnam, whereas, I'm pretty sure that several in-game item descriptions indicate that Yharnam pretty much sprang up around Laurence and the healing church.</TEXT>

edit:  In answer to your other question, if wilhem did indeed create or summon or place Rom where he is to stop the mensis/choir/church rituals and practice, it wouldn't be inconsistent per se, as Rom is seemingly just a band-aid to the problem, a temporary fix, and not a final and actual solution, so Wilhem's desire is that you put a full stop to it, rather than rely on his temporrary solution.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> And while I appreciate the fashion options without having to upgrade all your armor to stay competitive, I actually think upgrading armor would be a good option to counter how ridiculously powerful the blood gems are in BB's PvP.


Armor choices aside, (besides pure fashion), and aside when plenty of us say fashion  stats,  armor wasn't just a matter of choosing stats carefully, it was (and still is, DaS2 pvp is pretty great) also choosing gear more carefully.</TEXT>

Of course, building new toons for PvP isn't as fast as a true speed-run, but it can still be done very fast, and depending on someone's play-time, it can be done in a few sessions, and even less if you don't bother to farm for the 27% and other top-tier gems, which aren't even necessary depending on the weapons you use, as you can still two to three shot a lot of people with the main game gems.</TEXT>

Worth noting, for a standard level 100-120 build for Co-Op and/or PvP, you want at least 40 vitality for health (especially due to co-op/invader -30% health handicap), 20 endurance (though I prefer 25, as 20 won't even give you every weapon's full 3 to 4 hit combo), and a primary damage stat at around 50.</TEXT>

 You'll notice a lot of different mechanics at play, more character stats and abilities to figure out, but the best thing is that the multiplayer is infinitely better than how slow and clunky the multiplayer in BB is, for both PvE and PvP :D

The game is already limited in builds, PvP, diverity, replayability (since it is fairly short is easy), and opening it up a bit to reward players where it's due (chunks from bosses, etc), and to allow people to have fun with each other is just fine with me.</TEXT>

BB's covenants are shallow and lacking, the PvE is very well designed, but also very short, it needs more multi-player features, and in general, between the lack of armor (and armor actually having function as much as fashion) and weapons, and thus creativity and variety, I really do believe that BB will have a much short shelf-life.</TEXT>

I put BB down for a bit and started playing SOFS a few weeks ago myself (along with vanilla to play with my brother), whereas, when DaS1 and DaS2, I couldn't put those down or play another game for a minimum of four to six months, and even then, I'd always come back for more PvE, PvP, and to try some new builds and ideas, like I couldn't get enough, compared to BB, where I have already made all the builds available, beaten the game+chalices with each toon, PvPd with them, and already sort of been sated, as it all feels so samey.</TEXT>

To me, it seems like FROM made it clear that they didn't want this game to be as much about griefing players with red invaders as the previous titles, hence bell-maidens only spawn statically in a few locations, when you invade you get a health nerf, and if you invade other places that don't have bell-maidens, then you will most likely be fighting a 2 v. 1 battle along with your health nerf.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> So even if you had all but beaten a new game cycle with a new character, taking into account other gear and insight items/armor you'd want to buy, at most you could only buy 4-10 chunks in one play-through, which isn't much, but it would depend on how you acquired and spent your insight, whether you did the chalices immediately or after the main game, and some other factors in there.</TEXT>

To further expand on it, once you learn Bloodborne (it isn't hard, as it is a very short game), it isn't hard to make new characters, or continue on older ones, to beat the game all over again and farm all the chunks on each playthrough.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> I know I'm late to the party, and I agree with some of your points, but I think you overlooked the real reason and the most important reason that the chikage is even worth mentioning or using, is that it is based around a Bloodtinge build - one of all of four to five different build types available in the game.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1219_365_1</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> Seriously, in terms of build and challenge options, this game is very lacking, and with how different the playstyle is on a Bloodtinge build is, it becomes important that we have chikage as a weapon and an option.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1219_365_2</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>


Aside the unique nature of the Chikage, the Bloodtinge build is the only build that can really utilize ranged weapons (namely Eve and repeating pistol) for consistant and decent damage, and no, I'm not counting the cannon with it's former 10 and now 12 bullet requirement, as you can get far more damage out of Eve with those same 10-12 bullets, and we won't even get into bone marrow ash.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1219_365_3</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> Again - it opens up a different play-style, and to utilize it to its fullest (as with any build really), you have to do more than just spam R1, and it can involve a lot more micro-management, which can be fun.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1219_365_4</DOCNO>

The point is, as others have said, the Chikage with an appropriate BT build is a very different and fun playstyle compared to how similar the other builds can play, and this is important in a game with very few build options.</TEXT>

I definately agree on the lag being a consistent turn-off in FROM games, but that hasn't stopped me, and others (who PvP far more ravenously and frequently than me) from enjoying these games well past their base PvE games, and well past their primes (and what would have been any equivelant game's prime).</TEXT>

I'm not bitching or complaining, as I love both games, but I am just providing your point with a counter-balance, as BB is extremely lacking when it comes to multi-player and PvP anyhow: never mind the stupid bell-system and the crap loading screens and connectivity problems, there are bigger issues with the shallow covenant system, a lack of invasions, and worst of all the immensely limited builds, not just in weapon choices and fashion, but also creativity and nuance.</TEXT>

The point is, for lots of FROM fans, they couldn't put down the Souls series games for months and years at a time, and not even two months past release, the same fans are already feeling done with BB because it is lacking in the many different options, covenants, and content the previous games have.</TEXT>

Strategy:  I used to fight this boss on half HP mode super slowly, baiting out his charge, his jump, or his vomit, but after killing him on a few characters, I got sick of taking 15-20 minutes for the perfect fight, and I started fighting him more aggressively, and ending the fight within 5-10 minutes, but it also depends on your build and weapons and etc.</TEXT>

The problem is the gaming industry at large, who have been mostly playing it safe on boring, formulaic game-play models (which you can't blame to a degree), but the lack of forward thinking, creativity, and innovation has caused much of the genre to grow stagnant and dull.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> People just don't get the same kind of thrills playing the same WoW or WoW-esque games decade after decade, and until a developer comes along to shake things up in some way, shape or form, people are willing to scratch that itch, even on boring and inferior products, settling for less while waiting for something better to come along.</TEXT>

Part of why I appreciate the men in my life, is that they are diverse, strong men from various backgrounds, and most of them aren't afraid to confront me or each other if they have a problem that needs fixing, or something that needs to be resolved, and they aren't afraid to deal with their feelings, and I am talking former jail-birds, welders, mechanics (myself, a fighter/martial artist), and seeing this post, reminds me of what I hate in people period - pointless whining, the inability or fear to address one's own problems, disorganzied back-stabbing, and so forth.</TEXT>

That being said, it isn't awkward, you just have to have the uncanny burial blade (cuz the regular one with waning gem slot sucks), and you can take that AR upwards of 600 relatively easy, and that is with regular depth 5 chalice drops, not the more rarer, top-of-the-line rank 20 gems or abysmal gems from bosses.</TEXT>

50 SKL

5 BT - dont add any into this, as you don't need it for anything, and fuck anything other than hunter's pistol anyhow for non BT builds :P

            	<TEXT> I hope they do fix it, as I love this wepaon and find it very fun to play with it, even though without the bug, it is kinda weak compared to other weapons, it can still be pimped out quite nicely :D


That being said, like any other obviously OP or broken shit, I don't see it as a matter of will they fix it, but when will they fix it?</TEXT>

But I also have the urge to make a new character anyhow, because I enjoy creating them, and I have this really bad-ass Lemmy Kilmister character model saved that I want to employ as more of a main character, as I have thoroughly been enjoying the SKL build, but I think it would be fun to bring the STR up to 25 for additional weapon usage.</TEXT>

I'm super annoyed and dissapointed in how FROM made competitive weapon optimizing so lop-sided, and it's a total bummer that they made it so hard to maximize a lot of weapon's potential (ie, the uncanny burial blade, as the waning slot ruins the base-line model).</TEXT>

I mean, I have multiple characters, and I've farmed a lot of chalices, and I have yet to see an abyssmal gem period 


Edit:  And that's not to say it shouldn't take farming/work/effort/frustration/redundancy to optimize our theoretical top-shelf OP Tonitrus that we've been discussing, but it's a lot of work to make simple/earlier game weapons shine, like the BoM and later the Burial Blade, and use it to its max :/</TEXT>

45 Vit (I think, might be 44 or 46)

22 End

12 STR

50 SKL

8 BT (whatever starter stat was)

15 Arc


I mean, I could easily adjust it to make it closer to a quality build, but I think anything over 100-110 is too high, as it cuts out a lot of meta-ranges in PvP, and is frankly just unnecessary, as I enjoy focused builds where you have to sacrafice some power/expertise over others.</TEXT>

Anyway, I ask because I wanted to make a quality build for PvP to have access to a variety of weapons (as variety is what has always made the souls games fun as fuck), yet remain competitive - so I wanted to use ludwig's (which I never really liked that much), the cleavers, and hearing that tonitrus can be pretty bad-ass on a quality build makes me happy as well :D


But first, I need to go find me an uncanny burial blade, and then I need %/flat arcane gems with less shitty negatives, and then, another blood rock... ugh.</TEXT>

I've been farming those flat arc gems, but so far no luck, because I keep getting the shitty -HP gems, though the few -kin/beast damage are great for PvP.


Do you use the regular burial blade with its shitty waning slot, or do you use an uncanny burial blade?</TEXT>

Oscar the Fateless straight up says, "...Regrettably, I have failed in my mission... *But perhaps you can keep the torch lit...* There is an old saying in my family... Thou who art Undead, art chosen..."


The whole "keep the torch lit" is a direct reference to the kiln of the first flame, and yet, you would have never known it your first time through, and even on subsequent play-throughs, it is absolutely easy to miss this tasty and subtle reference.</TEXT>

I warn you - if you pick up bloodborne, it will likely ruin gaming for you, and if you play the previous souls titles, every other game will feel like hello kitty island adventure where you run around with a bunch of school girls slapping each other with wet noodles, and hardly any game out there will even come close to the satisfaction, risk, reward, and enjoyment of playing a game made by FROM Soft...

As for other reasons to increase your gun damage, sure, occasionally an enemy will have a slice of HP left after a fight, and it can be convenient to shoot them once or twice to kill them, but again, it isn't needed or warranted if that's not how you've dedicated your build, though it depends on your playstyle.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> It might seem handy or helpful to have that little extra damage, as sometimes we do find ourselves dying in a situation where an enemy only has a tiny slice of life left and one more gunshot would kill it, but the fact remains that in the same scenario above, it doesn't change the amount of attacks it takes to kill an enemy:

1st parry+visceral = 1,050 damage - enemy has 1950 HP left now

2nd parry+visceral = 1,050 damage - enemy now has 900 health left

3rd parry+visceral - 1,050 damage - enemy is now dead, but the damage added through pumping another 10-20 points in BT is negligible, because he would have been dead anyway, and thus you wasted points in BT.</TEXT>

I know people can argue any number of ways on this, but imo BT and gun damage is useless outside dedicated builds, and thus the weapon you use is a matter of personal preference, be it for effectiveness, feel, or style, and I've just found the regular old Hunter's Pistol to be too damn awesome and reliable to not use, and it is easy enough to get it to +9 (along with your other favorite weapons) to where you can use it as viable damage output should you find yourself facing off with an enemy who winds up with a tiny sliver of health left (though less so in depth 5 chalices and higher NG+ cycles).</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> And if you are going to invest that much in BT (Eve requires 18 I think, which is a lot for non-primary damage), and you don't pump it up more to use a chikage, you are pretty much gimping what could otherwise be a higher damage, more focused skill build, or wasting what could be a full (40-50) bloodtinge build with a good 20-25 in skill, utilizing your stats best with chikage as your main weapon and eve for damage and utility.</TEXT>

If you want or care to do actual damage with your firearm, yes, I'd say go full BT or a skill/BT build with eve and/or rifle spear and chikage, but if you are just using firearms for utility, then waste as few possible points in BT as you can get away with:D</TEXT>

For multiple enemies, I'd suggest either playing unlocked for quick turning to be able to stab whoever is coming at you, or be quick to flick the lock on to whoever gets closest, enabling you to still spam constantly without getting swarmed, though with how bad the camera can be at times, it might get you killed until you are more accustomed to it.</TEXT>

Darkest dungeon is a RNG party-based dungeon crawling game, where you recruit characters who die permanent deaths, focus on party comps and smart item usage and upgrades of your town hub, characters and armor, and it is pretty similar to the Cthulu mythos of crazed cults and mysterious dark portals and Eldritch truth.</TEXT>

I've fought him in his weaker versions more head on which was easy, but that is the strategy I used to beat him, as I wasn't doing so hot facing him head on, as a lot of times he would charge at me even if I was close to him, and I hardly had the time or room to dodge, and it just complicated the fight too much for me, though in his last phase he hardly would want to charge me at all, so I did some very hesitant, scared shitless face-to-face combat, but I wasn't happy about it :D</TEXT>

That being said, I thought the variations within BB were pretty great, from gothic cities to the woods, to the nightmares, to the dungeons and so forth, but I'd rather them keep it focused, rather than trying to cram in a volcano world or any other number of cool environments that might not have fit, though hey probably could have implemented a marsh for sure, and maybe a snowy area (more so than the outside of Cainhurst castle which is very small).</TEXT>

The problem is imo, Dark Souls is just one hell of a game to live up to, and it was so new and fresh and unseen in the gaming world (not including DeS here), whereas BB in all its different glory, is still sort of more of the same.</TEXT>

Another question in line with this is - has anyone found a build (combo of runes and gems) to really maximize visceral damage, and make it more worthwhile?</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> I mean, either way, it is a valuable move anyhow to buy time and avoid direct combat/damage, but I'm wondering what the end game numbers can look.</TEXT>

That being said, anyway, how does the damage look later on in the game with more options?</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> Ie, the +flat damage blood gems are pointless on say, my main high level toon with pumped STR/SKL, but for those who have come across the +flat damage gems on their onebros, do they wind up being the equivelant of Raw type enchants for your higher level weapons, and thus are better for OneBros?</TEXT>

While other games play more like movies (quick time events, and simple, easy narratives) that are almost impossible to lose even if you try, Bloodborne (and FROM in general) utilizes the gaming experience in a way that seldom developers do, not just in their mysterious narratives, but they force you to learn from your mistakes, as when the rubber hits the road in these games, there really is no just derping and dragging your way through these game.</TEXT>

For example, I mainly wanted to create this dungeon:  http://www.gamefaqs.com/boards/805577-bloodborne/71574146

It is a Lower Loran with fetid + rotting offerings


Yet, if I try to even make a lower loran chalice dungeon, I don't even have the options to use the offerings of fetid and rotting - so how can I even create a chalice to use that glyph in the first place?</TEXT>

I mean, GW2 does large scale/siege combat much better, and is a little bit more action oriented, Rift did class trees/systems and basic combat better, Tera has more interactive and fun comat, EvE carries actual risks and rewards that will get your heart pumping, but WoW combat just feels so flat and dated.</TEXT>

I mean - from equipment slots being filled with abilities just like mod slots give you abilities in Eve, to the devs trying to control RMT, to the 'you are your equipment' (in eve, your ship=you), to the security statuses of green, yellow, and red, to controlling territory, to losing your gear on death, it all seems pretty similar.</TEXT>

I don't say these things to continue what I see as a fairly justified bitch-fest about the state of MWO, but from the bigger picture, that MWO is that crack-baby that was dropped on its head too many times and wound up in foster care and the only people willing to adopt it also abuse it.</TEXT>

Point is, while there are many fun games out there, few have the risk and reward factors, immersion, compelling and mysterious stories, lore, and fun gameplay wrapped together as well as the Souls series does.</TEXT>

While I'm open to any game, regardless of reviews and opinions, to help narrow it down, I can add a few critiques or reviews of other noteworthy games and series:


Morrowwind, Oblivion, Skyrim, that series:  Fun, to a point, often redundant, repetitive, weaker combat/magic systems, worth their dollar value in entertainment, but the stories and characters were never compelling enough that I ever finished a single game, even after logging 60-100+ hours on some.</TEXT>
