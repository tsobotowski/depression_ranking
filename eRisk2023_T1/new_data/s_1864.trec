In general For the purposes of first time encounters, especially to a planet this far away, a flyby mission makes a lot more sense, mainly because it is

* Simplicity, you do not need to know that much about another place to just flyby it, whereas entering into orbit requires you to have a much better understanding of the system you are trying to enter into orbit around,  A great example is until only a few months ago we did not know about Pluto's 3 other moons.</TEXT>

So if things were going south and you want to cut your losses, aborting the Dragon capsule, bringing the 1st stage in for landing, and just accepting the loss of the second stage, seems much more reasonable and has a much better chance of working than attempting a full stack landing.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> I saw a post over at /r/MH370 talking about how they were disappointed that even if the plane was found and black boxes recovered, it was likely that the voice recorder would not say much because it will have most likely looped over.</TEXT>

It just seems like this has happened a few times where the voice recorder has over written and it makes it a lot harder to understand what happened.</TEXT>

It also seems like storage space should not be an issue, new micro SD cards are as large as 120 GB so even with special designing to make the hard drive crash resistant, it seems like it should not be that hard to get a hard drive that has enough space for a few hours of audio recording.</TEXT>
