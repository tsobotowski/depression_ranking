Now make a folder under file manager call it DDLC Fallen Angel if you want, you can name it anything really... Then extract the zip of the base ddlc game with Zachiver into the folder you just created, then take your mod and unzip it's contents into Game folder inside the DDLC folder... Then open Joiplay click the + button and name your game then were it says game version put 1.1.1 cause that's ddlc version then under that choose exe just go to your folder you made then inside the DDLC folder then select DDLC.EXE and then press done it will setup it up then just press play on your new icon inside of joiplay and your ready to play your ddlc mod or mods on your phone!!!</TEXT>

Yuri im not sure about how I would rate Her so fourth seems most reasonable...

            	<TEXT>Yes I actually did, I install Our Castle Walls and moved my backup save back into the game and I was getting errors with my saves, turns out each file under the renpy folder made new copies of each file in that folder and I deleted the wrong ones and some how it caused the game to mixed the mod up with the original game and had both playing at the same time as you can see by the photo.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Oh well I got the update for Our Castle Walls and made a backup of my saves then I installed the new 1.1.5 version of Our Castle Walls and I moved my saves back in well I was getting a error with my saves and it was taking me to the renpy folder and it turns out inside the renpy folder it doubled each file for what ever reason so I thought I deleted the right files turns out I was wrong... So when I booted up my game it was confused and was mixing both Our Castle Walls and the Original game together causing this effect along with audio from both the mod and the Original game lol... My saves still didn't work so my guess now is that those 1.1.4 saves wont work with 1.1.5 version of the game, which is funny cause it's just a save file.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>What I'm referring to when I mention how I see things differently what I mean is I can only feel and do but so much threw a chat on the internet... With someone in IRL i can feel presences of them, have them next to me, see them, hug them, hold them, feel emotions right next to them, talk if possible face to face, go places, explore and not feel this alone and lonely gap like I would still feel threw online... But the IRL feelings I have wanted that for the longest time now, and ya you can feel some of those things threw online with someone but when I allow myself to do that it makes it feel worse so that's why I say that's why I mention online and IRL like I do.</TEXT>

Difficulties with talking and people, you could put me in front of someone new and I would not know how to hold a conversation, wouldn't know how to talk or make things not awkward, my heart would race my breath would become shaky I might would shake... I don't think I would even manage to have a girlfriend and I don't care what people say about "oh you'll see" or "You just wait you mind will change" I would love to have a girlfriend, no one around me except this group talks to me I have had little to any social interaction for year's!</TEXT>
