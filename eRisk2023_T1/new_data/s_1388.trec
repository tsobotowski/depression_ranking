            	<TEXT>This is a bit of a double edged sword however as that is because of how the Atticus blunts the sounds in comparison.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>I feel like my 'perfect' would be, LCD-X with the physical weight of the Atticus headphones, the mid-bass impact of the Atticus, and somewhere in-between the two in terms of whatever causes it to fatigue my ears.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>And i also feel that the Subpac's physical impact could fill in the gaps on the LCD-X, knowing that some of that physicality does transfer through your body up to your ear drums.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Also i really just love the whole planar sound of the LCD-X. In terms of matching to the 'Funktion One' stack type of sound, the LCD-X gets there in spades in every way except the mid-bass.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>From my research, I just don't know if there's any other headphones that would be more suitable for this than the LCD-X. I hope this post is useful for some people who may be on a similar journey to me.</TEXT>
