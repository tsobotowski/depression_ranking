Slept for only 4 hours for almost a year .... I was in the last batch in my coaching institute so they taught us total bullshit in classroom so I studied the Entire syllabus from youtube and by reading ncert .... I am also feeling the same .... I kept pushing my self and didn't stop... from 85 in feb to 93 in july and hoping for 98+ in august (marks ke hissab se 86 toh pakke hi hai) .... And now I have completely lost all the motivation to do anything at all.... whenever I sit for studying the whole vibe of my desk turns negative and shit.... But still try.... So whenevr you feel that you are alone.... Bas idhar ek aur aisa post bana dena hum sab dukh baatne aajayenge .... tension mat le you have done your best and we all are proud of you ..... Chal bas abhi all the best aage ke liye... bye bye :)</TEXT>

And to deviate everyone's attention from that.... the ruling party (his dad's party... and the car in this video is also of someone from the same part... BJP) put the famous Bollywood Actor ShahRukh Khan's son in judicial custody in a drug case.... Now people completely forgot about the farmers and all the attention is on SRK's son's drug case ... and in my opinion SRK's son is completely innocent and he is just being used as a scapegoat by the government to cover road rash on the farmers.... Let's hope that justice prevails for this video too and in both the other cases.... and lets hope India doesn't become China in the near future!!</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Once I had gone on a date (my one and only dat till date) in my 11th STD.... It went pretty well... I liked her she liked me.... But when I returned home that night my dad confronted me about it .... He had seen me going out with her ... And he bate the shit out of me ... Like he hit me with belt(I still have those scars on my chest) and slapped me... All that was ... I'd say something I could handle and deal with I thought about telling it to her the next time we meet at our classes(we went to the same coaching) but exactly 2 days after the date when I was coming home from my classes I got the news that one of my childhood best friend A (his initails) has commited suicide... I was completely caught off gaurd by this news as this is something that no one would expect I guess.... I went to his building and unfortunately I was his dead body and fucking hell his face .... Uuuuuhhhhhh ..... I can never erase that picture from my face .... There was so much blood around his body(he had jumped from the building).... And his face was completely crushed.... And at this time I was 15 by the way so I was way immature than I am right now and that scene and his face and all the why didn't I's fucked up my mental health to an unimaginable level.... And the next thing I remember is not talking (or texting) properly to everyone around me for atleast the next 2-3 weeks and I guess I needed that time to bring myself back together.... And due to that I lost contact or bonds with so many friends people even started ghosting me after that .... And yes as you can guess I couldn't even tell my date the truth nor could I have a legit normal conversation ..... So she had also started ignoring me to whole next level ... As if she see straight through me.... And I don't want to sound arrogant or something but I am not that "please ek baar toh meri baat sun lo!!</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Once I had gone on a date (my one and only dat till date) in my 11th STD.... It went pretty well... I liked her she liked me.... But when I returned home that night my dad confronted me about it .... He had seen me going out with her ... And he bate the shit out of me ... Like he hit me with belt(I still have those scars on my chest) and slapped me... All that was ... I'd say something I could handle and deal with I thought about telling it to her the next time we meet at our classes(we went to the same coaching) but exactly 2 days after the date when I was coming home from my classes I got the news that one of my childhood best friend A (his initails) has commited suicide... I was completely caught off gaurd by this news as this is something that no one would expect I guess.... I went to his building and unfortunately I was his dead body and fucking hell his face .... Uuuuuhhhhhh ..... I can never erase that picture from my face .... There was so much blood around his body(he had jumped from the building).... And his face was completely crushed.... And at this time I was 15 by the way so I was way immature than I am right now and that scene and his face and all the why didn't I's fucked up my mental health to an unimaginable level.... And the next thing I remember is not talking (or texting) properly to everyone around me for atleast the next 2-3 weeks and I guess I needed that time to bring myself back together.... And due to that I lost contact or bonds with so many friends people even started ghosting me after that .... And yes as you can guess I couldn't even tell my date the truth nor could I have a legit normal conversation ..... So she had also started ignoring me to whole next level ... As if she see straight through me.... And I don't want to sound arrogant or something but I did not beg infront of her to hear me out cuz I knew I was not wrong back then.... So I never told her what happened.... And maybe that's on me .... This was in 2019..... It's been like 2 years and still she doesn't even know anything about this so it's like I was the bad person for the failure of that relationship and nor do my friends know about it... I am scared that if I tell them then they will just joke about it and make fun of me so I never told them about it.... And yeah.... I don't want her sympathy or anything but I just want her to know that I was not the bad person in this situation... So yup it's been 2 years and now I am going to get admitted into an iit (most prestigious Indian colleges) ... I am happy about that but also sad about this shit.... I wish I could clear this someday... I want to clear this so fucking badly that even if she send a simple hey to me...I swear I ill clear everything but idk how to tell her now...</TEXT>
