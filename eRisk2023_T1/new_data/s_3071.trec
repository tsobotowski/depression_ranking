Also, it's sometimes the case that individuals who indulge in positive fantasies about future successes experience psychological enjoyment in the present which reduces their incentive to actively pursue the goal in the immediate future (McClelland, Koestner,   Weinberger, 1989; Oettingen   Mayer, 2002).</TEXT>
