She wants to spend at max $200, but my concern is if we are ultimately going to get a higher quality tent (either as an upgrade or to replace one of the cheapos), I'd rather not spend the cash on a low/intermediate quality tent and just jump right to the higher end because it ultimately saves money.</TEXT>

Yearly, my wife and I bring in the following (gross):

* Me: $81k/yr
* Wife: $65k/yr

My wife and I have two outstanding debts:

* A home mortgage with $154k remaining at 4.125% (fixed), minimum payment of $1380/mo.</TEXT>

* A private student loan with $51k remaining at 3.170% (variable but capped at 3.5%) with minimum payment of $557/mo

Given the relatively low interest rates on each, I have also been investing.</TEXT>

* $70/mo into VPAIX (we are over the 25% tax level)
* $230/mo split across a diversified investment portfolio (EWX, PID, SCHA, SCHM, VNQ, VONV, VOOG)
* ~$200/mo into a company ESPP (15% discount off ticker price of first or last day of fiscal quarter, whichever is lower)
* $28/mo into I-series treasury bonds (don't laugh :) )

I am not including 401k/403b/pension payments here.</TEXT>

Note that this does not include any windfalls; tax returns usually are around $6k/yr for us (this should shrink as interest goes down), I get a yearly bonus of about $4k, etc, so the date will likely be sooner.</TEXT>

[A multi shelf steel storage unit from Lowes](http://www.lowes.com/pd_319468-1281-MR4824WGB_0__?productId=3529780)

PVC piping and bulkheads to connect fog modules to posts, and to reservoir

Flourescent lights (cheaper than LED and last just about as long) in 6500k and 2000-3000k colors

Another example is Allegro from Giuliani - I can play clearly except for the the notes where the 3rd and 4th finger are used on the fret hand - I can focus on placing them perfectly, but it slows me down considerably.</TEXT>

**Citrus Curd**

* Finely grated zest of 3 citrus fruits (at least 1 lemon)
* Juice of those 3 fruits (again, at least 1 lemon)
* 3 large eggs
* 2 free range egg yolks

* 100g unsalted butter cut in chunks

**Optional meringue:**

* Reserve the 2 whites from the yolks above
* 100g additional caster sugar
* pinch cream of tartar
* 1.5tsp cornstarch dissolved into 2 tbsp of water

Bring a pot of water to a boil, and grab a large mixing bowl that can be set over top.</TEXT>

2) I went into audio midi settings and verified that the cable was set as 48k audio.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_897_1162_24</DOCNO>

3) In audio midi settings I raised the volume from the default to about 40%

4) In rocksmith, I changed the audio engine settings from the default 4 to 6 (I had previously changed this, but it seems to have reverted back).</TEXT>

5) In rocksmith audio options I increased the realtone cable gain from the default to 4.1

As it stands, I am now nailing every note.</TEXT>

At the time 1 LTC was 21.149991995 dollars USD:

So is the math:
21.149991995 * 0.00000051 * N where N is the number of TIPS?</TEXT>

Assumptions:
I'm assuming purchasing 3 HD7990's (I work for a large telecom company and can likely get better deals than the average joe), but I'm assuming a hardware cost of $4k and a hash rate of 3000 KH/s.
I'm assuming a 1250 watt power supply, and our power costs $0.11/kWh.</TEXT>

Looking at the apple discussion forums, there are hundreds of threads about bluetooth issues (like this one: https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3200456?start=0 tstart=0), but no comprehensive solution, and the overall consensus seems to be that the apple bluetooth stack is a cluster****.</TEXT>

2.1+EDR should work for the magic mouse, keyboard, and both of the bluetooth headsets, I just need to know that the devices won't have any issues pairing after coming out of sleep (it is a HTPC and needs to be easy for the fiancee to use, that includes devices waking up).</TEXT>
