            	<TEXT>Ima try to get a therapist tbh, I don't think I got the money or time tbh, but I'll try She wanted more time to hang with her friends and started talking to me less and less, then by time she ended up cuddled with a guy friend of hers, 2 days before she broke up with me, she then started falling for him, and told me that she doesn't want to be with my anymore, and she wants to try something different, I tried to win her back by talking to her and I did she even wrote me an entire letter telling me how much she loved me and begged me to come back, tho it was only for 1 day, she just sent me a text, saying how she wanted to be done with me, and how she didn't want me to try anymore, how she wants what's the best for her, and how she wanted to be selfish for a while to get what she wants, which really hurts, because I was ready to do everything for her, I was even saving up money so I could get her gifts and take her on alot of dates, but I guess I just wasnt enough, tho it's okay, she's happy, that all that matters, idc about myself, as long as she's happy, I'm glad, that was my goal from the beginning to make her happy, tho it's sad that someone better than me will make her happy</TEXT>
