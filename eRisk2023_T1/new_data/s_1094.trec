When that's how you start a discussion about a trans woman, and simply keep repeating a claim that being trans is a mental illness and that affirmative treatment is "mutilation", while providing no evidence of that claim and ignoring evidence to the contrary, and calling me a Nazi for disagreeing (nevermind that gay and trans people were put to death in Nazi Germany), it's not a stretch to make that assumption.</TEXT>

[From the author of that study](http://health.usnews.com/health-news/articles/2014/09/10/puberty-suppression-benefits-gender-questioning-teens-study):

"Since **puberty suppression is a fully reversible medical intervention**, it provides adolescents and their families with time to explore their gender dysphoric feelings, and [to] make a more definite decision regarding the first steps of actual gender reassignment treatment at a later age," said study lead author Dr. Annelou de Vries.</TEXT>
