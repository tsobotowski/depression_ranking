I tried about a dozen times to post it to my timeline (I tried refreshing, typing different captions, closing and re-opening the tab) and each time got this error: http://imgur.com/a/lHQaa  (first image)

I tried sharing it directly from the youtube page (instead of pasting the link in my status, and I got this error: http://imgur.com/a/lHQaa (same link, second image)

If you want to argue about her being in an abusive relationship in the first place, people end up there by being too trusting and forgiving; that's the only fault that makes someone end up there, and you don't realize you're in that situation until it actually gets ugly, at which point, it is dangerous to try to leave.</TEXT>

So, all of that is just natural part of being human, and although I don't know the extent of scientific study of these concepts, it is a simple fact that we are run by electrical impulses, and it is clear to anyone who has felt that emotion radiating from a person, or who has just known something was up with grandma and had the urge to call her, we can pick up on the electrical signals of other people.</TEXT>

Last semester, I am in Grad school btw, during a meeting about our theses (dissertation in other nations), just to go over general guidelines, I asked a serious question about the scope of the topic area (trans-atlantic comparative policy as opposed to a purely European focus), and the professor leading the meeting did the same obnoxious laugh in my face and rather than saying "yes, people have done that; it fits the program name well."</TEXT>

Some possible explanations (there is not necessarily one right explanation; these may all be valid and true, with some applying to some cases, and others to other cases):
