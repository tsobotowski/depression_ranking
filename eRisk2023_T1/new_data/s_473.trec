Anyway, my argument here is this:

If the British would have partitioned Kashmir along religious lines in 1947 (with the Muslim-majority areas going to Pakistan and the Hindu-majority and Buddhist-majority areas going to India), then there would have been no decades-long Kashmir dispute and conflict.</TEXT>
        </DOC>

            	<DOCNO>s_473_705_3</DOCNO>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_473_705_4</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

In addition to this, Pakistan might not have went nuclear without the Kashmir dispute, which in turn might have meant that there would not have been a risk of a nuclear war in South Asia in the 1990s and beyond.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_473_705_5</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Likewise, without the Kashmir dispute, Pakistan's military and intelligence service might not be as pampered and might not have as much influence as they actually have in real life.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_473_705_6</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Also, with less Indo-Pakistani tensions, both India and Pakistan would have been able to spend more money on things such as economic development and mutual cooperation instead of spending that money on their militaries (armed forces).</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_473_705_7</DOCNO>

In addition to this, while  the war over Bangladesh might have still happened (whether in 1971 or in a different year) without the Kashmir dispute, this war in itself might not have derailed Indo-Pakistani relations in the long(er)-run.</TEXT>

However, I did previously see an article in what appears to be a legal journal which argues in favor of having a court ruling get rid of the natural-born U.S. citizen requirement for the U.S. Presidency:

As for the slippery slope part, I would like to point out that, as far as I know, a similar rationale which is used to deny naturalized U.S. citizens the U.S. Presidency was previously used to justify the forced internment of Japanese-Americans (a majority of whom I think were U.S. citizens) during World War II.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_473_1310_7</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Likewise, a similar paranoia existed in some Americans' minds when Roman Catholics Al Smith (in 1928) and JFK (in 1960) ran for the U.S. Presidency due to their fear that they would take orders from the Pope.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_473_1310_9</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

If a naturalized U.S. citizen who runs for the U.S. Presidency seems suspicious, then the American voters can simply not elect this candidate in the first place, just like they can avoid electing natural-born U.S. citizens who are running for the U.S. Presidency and who seem suspicious.</TEXT>

Thus, again, my question here is this--do you think that elective orchiectomies (castrations) for sterilization purposes should be available to men in a safe, medical setting (as opposed to in a "back-alley")?</TEXT>

Frankly, to me, if one replaces the religious aspect with the ethnic aspect, this Safavid policy appears to be very similar to some of the policies of European nationalists in the 19th century and beyond; after all, as far as I know, some/many European nationalists in the 19th century and beyond (such as those in France) pursued policies such as teaching everyone the same dialect of their official national language in order to create and foster a greater sense of national unity and cohesiveness in their countries.</TEXT>

As for my own thoughts on this, here you go:

Al Gore (U.S. President between 2001 and 2009):

-9/11 still occurs due to the fact that, as far as I know, at least some of the issues (such as various U.S. intelligence agencies failing to sufficiently work with each other) which failed to prevent 9/11 would have still existed in this scenario.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_473_1497_4</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

-After 9/11, Gore would have still invaded Afghanistan due to the Taliban refusing to accept all of the conditions in his post-9/11 ultimatum to them.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_473_1497_5</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>After helping the Northern Alliance overthrow the Taliban, the U.S. would have successfully killed Osama Bin Laden.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_473_1497_6</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>However, after Bin Laden's death, Al-Qaeda would still continue to exist and to function with new leadership (but would gradually become weakened over time).</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_473_1497_7</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Hamid Karzai is still installed as the new President of Afghanistan in this scenario, and while there is much more of a U.S. and Western focus on Afghanistan in this scenario, a lot of the issues which affected the Western war effort in Afghanistan in real life would have still been present in this scenario.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_473_1497_8</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Thus, I suspect that the U.S. will eventually lose its patience in Afghanistan in this scenario (and earlier than in real life) and thus eventually push for the creation of a Northern Alliance-"reformed" Taliban unity government in Afghanistan with a small long-lasting Western troop presence in Afghanistan in order to help keep the peace there.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> OK--basically, I (the OP here) am a 22-year-old gender-fluid/cross-dreaming male who would like to get castrated (Yes, castrated, as in getting my testicles removed) and is willing to do whatever it takes in order to get this done.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_473_1518_2</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Now, why exactly do I want to get castrated?</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_473_1518_3</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Well, first of all, I would like to get sterilized in a way which cannot ever fail (after all of the remaining sperm in my body already die off, that is).</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Vasectomies can fail, all other available contraceptives can fail, and as for Vasalgel, it is way too untested for me.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_473_1518_5</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Plus, I have never heard anyone give me an extremely good reason as for why exactly Vasalgel is incapable of ever failing.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_473_1518_6</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>The fact that Vasalgel hasn't failed yet doesn't necessarily mean that it will never fail for anyone; after all, I would think that vasectomies likewise had a 100% effectiveness rate before the first historical vasectomy failure actually occurred.</TEXT>

Also, before anyone brings up the idea of me only having sex with women who share my own views in regards to pregnancy, I would like to point out that I would never rely on any woman's word that she will get an abortion (or give our hypothetical future offspring for adoption, for that matter); after all, a woman can simply change her mind on this later on.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_473_1518_8</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Also, abstaining from vaginal sex with all fertile and potentially fertile women for the rest of my life is likewise both completely unrealistic and completely unacceptable for me.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_473_1518_9</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Thus, I have to take matters into my own hands and seek out castration (Yes, castration, as in the removal of both of my testicles) by any means necessary.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_473_1518_10</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Afterwards, I will need to utilize hormone replacement therapy in order to deal with the less pleasant effects of castration.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_473_1518_11</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Also, I would like to point out that I would like to regulate my sex drive and that, as a gender-fluid/cross-dreaming person, I might very well want to take female hormones after my planned castration if I am still (somehow) able to indefinitely get erections (using my penis, which I intend to keep indefinitely) afterwards.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>I mean, the idea of me becoming a six-foot-tall beauty strongly appeals to me, and not in a sexual way.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_473_1518_13</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>However, at the same time, just to be safe, I want to keep all of my options open in regards to which hormone replacement therapy I should take after my planned castration (Yes, castration).</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_473_1518_14</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Anyway, what I am wondering is if anyone who is either a eunuch or a trans-woman can give me my advice in regards to utilizing hormone replacement therapy (either kind) and in regards to living a life without gonads in general.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>In addition, I would also like to hear about the sex lives of eunuchs, specifically in regards to erections, orgasm, et cetera, since this information is certainly of personal interest to me.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_473_1518_17</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Also, one more question--exactly how long will I need to wait after castration in order to be completely sure that all of the remaining sperm in my body are already dead?</TEXT>
        </DOC>

            	<DOCNO>s_473_1518_18</DOCNO>

And Yes, if anyone has any doubts in regards to this, this is certainly a completely serious post.</TEXT>
