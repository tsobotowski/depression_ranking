            	<TEXT> I know the following (if I'm incorrect, please let me know):

* Flying Swallow technique
* All throw moves
* Blood Rain combo (Eclipse Scythe)

I ask about the invincibility because that can be used to mitigate the enemy's attacks when you're being overwhelmed by the sheer number of enemies or certain attacks that aren't completely blockable (like incendiary shurikens-- I FUCKING HATE INCENDIARY SHURIKENS... lol).</TEXT>

That's why wrestlers climb the ladder faster when they win, because the fact that the other wrestlers aren't in position to stop them gives them more confidence to climb faster, and those two factors result in reaching the title more quickly.</TEXT>

Since Wolverine is so small, I was hoping that, for instance, if he's on the inside (I'm using Hulk) and he's hammering me with combos, and I get one good heavy strike to connect, he should go flying across the screen, since it's literally The Hulk, and Wolverine is like 5'3 and "only" around 300 pounds.</TEXT>

Maybe I'm being too picky, but I just wish that the character who's the strongest being in the entire MCU would be able to have not only the advantage of doing heavy damage due to his size and strength, but also being able to overpower small, rushdown characters with one move that would force them outside and create space.</TEXT>

Like I said, it might be something I could get used to, and tbh, I do appreciate the fact that different characters all have different stances, even to the extent that some don't even touch the ground (although it might be cool if you could choose to float or walk as Superman or something, since he doesn't levitate everywhere in the comics/films).</TEXT>

Regardless, here's a list of things she's done/hasn't done that makes me way beyond skeptical:

* Told me her first name was one thing, but her first name is listed as another on her info page
* Claims she works with kids, mainly in the "activity area"... but she tells me she doesn't get off of work until midnight at the earliest and 3 AM at the latest.</TEXT>

* Posted a status about how her friend was at her house at 10:45 or so the other day, even though she told me she was at work

And, like I said in the title, whether via cell or Facebook, she has not once sent the first message of a conversation in all of at least 7 or 8 conversations, despite all the "OMG I like you so much, you're so cute, I'll text you in the morning," etc (all of which I roll my eyes at).</TEXT>

So, how much of the reputation of pitchers being poor hitters is because of the reasons you just explained (tiring oneself out by throwing so many pitches), as opposed to pitchers just not being good hitters for seemingly no good reason (similar to how quarterbacks are known to be fragile and not able to take hits like other offensive players, and big men in basketball are known to be poor free-throw shooters)?</TEXT>

For context, record after wrestlers' first two losses (whether by DQ, countout, pinfall, or submission) in WWE/WWF/WWWF, only counting singles matches:

* Brock Lesnar: 11-2
* Kane: 4-2
* The Undertaker: 32-2
* Ultimate Warrior: 12-2
* Hulk Hogan: 6-2
* Andre The Giant: 31-2

Goldberg actually retired undefeated (24-0) in one-on-one matches during his WWE career, with two draws (against Kane and Shawn Michaels respectively).</TEXT>

She's always right, I'm always wrong, and if I:

* Go to the kitchen to get her a drink (which she doesn't drink because she thought she wanted it but really didn't)
* Go across the street to buy her something to eat (which she doesn't eat because she fell asleep)
* Go to the bathroom to get her an Aspirin because she has a headache
* Go get her another drink because the first one I got for her is warm since she didn't drink it,

I'm a terrible person if I tell her I don't feel like getting up for the fifth time in an hour, and going back to the kitchen to heat up her food.</TEXT>

I do know certain things that I think I left out, like how he would lash out at referees for trying to raise his arm after a win (despite being a babyface-- that's typically a heel move), or the fact that after his first match (I think), Gene Okerlund attempted to interview him, and Goldberg just walked away without saying anything.</TEXT>

Plus the fact that he quite literally won 173 straight matches, including a World Championship victory over one of the most accomplished wrestlers of all time, and I don't recall hearing him brag about it ever (in kayfabe-- though, to be fair, he was never much of a talker).</TEXT>

* **(4)** Super speed

* **(5)** Danger intuition (the ability to see or sense imminent danger to oneself without having to literally see it with one's own eyes; Spider-Man's Spider-Sense, for example)

* **(6)** A character whose main power is superhuman accuracy with projectiles, archery weapons, or whatever they can get their hands on.</TEXT>

Kane broke a mirror, unmasked against his will, and had a horrible streak of losses and bad breaks for the next *seven years*...

Then, as SOON as seven years passed, he went on a very solid winning streak (11 straight wins from the end of June to the beginning of October), and during that winning streak won his first world championship in over a decade.</TEXT>

Also, to summarize what you said about 3-4 vs 4-3, it seems like 3-4 is better against outside runs (since you get the extra speed with the additional linebacker), whereas 4-3 is good against inside runs, with the two tackles attempting to clog the middle.</TEXT>

For:

* The alleged suit used in the P-G film has never turned up, even after 45 some odd years
* Many men have claimed to be "the guy in the suit," and their stories all contradict one another (although honestly, fake or not, this might be expected)
* In the P-G film, the alleged creatures has arms nearly as long as its legs, completely unlike a human, even one in a suit
* Some claim that if you look closely at the forehead, you can see the crest moving up and down, which would be indicative of muscles and skin, not rubber
* Some claim that Roger Patterson and Bob Gimlin simply did not have the resources to pull off such a massive, long-lasting hoax
* Some claim that the alleged creature seen in the P-G film walks in such a way that would be almost impossible for a human in a suit to replicate

Against:

* A minimal breeding population of large primates would have to number in the thousands, and if that's the case, there's very little chance that they could escape detection, especially for this long
* Primates do not swing their arms when they walk like in the P-G film
* There is no fossil evidence of anything that would fit the description of what we know as Bigfoot or Sasquatch
* Bodies are never found, nor is fecal matter
* Nests, colonies, etc.</TEXT>

Anyway, since taking it for the first time, I feel the strangest combination of the following:

* Slight nausea
* Lightheadedness/dizziness (sometimes feels like my head is "spinning")
* Fatigue
* Horniness

I have no idea if this is normal or not, or even if it's a placebo effect at work, but... it feels sooooooo goooooood... _

I'm not at all concerned or asking for a diagnosis.</TEXT>
