Interestingly, on more and more busy sections of the UK motorway network, the hard shoulder (as it's called in the UK) is being opened up to flowing traffic by use of special signs above that clearly indicate when you can and can't drive in these lanes.</TEXT>

The episode did jump around a lot and where others have said was because it was too short, I think was because they tried to do too much in a short time resulting in a flawed presentation (too rushed *and* too confusing depending on your level of series immersion)
