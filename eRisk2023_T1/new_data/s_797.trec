            	<TEXT>This is a good question, at first you might think about putting and ADC in another lane, but honestly you don't have to because the rest of the game will be 3v5 anyway since the ennemy ADC will be at 1/12 at 30 minutes (seriously, in all the games we played there wasn't one time where the ADC managed to do anything after the lane phase) and the support will have rage quitted, while your team will have a Cho' with 11 stacks and 500Ap able to 1v1 everyone instead of some lame ADC that need constant babysitting and a swain that does a shit ton of damage.</TEXT>
