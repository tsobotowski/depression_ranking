And the first thing I ever read that's written by Neil Gaiman, and which in turn made me fall in love with him, was [this writing advice post on his Tumblr.](http://neil-gaiman.tumblr.com/post/107713982316/i-have-been-trying-to-write-for-a-while-now-i) That's just a pure and fantastic genius of a mind he is.</TEXT>

I wasn't least bit impressed that he was a prolific writer of so many books because of how the Church of Scientology turned out in the lives of a large number of its past members, who were physically and psychologically abused to great degrees, and  tortured by punishments such as licking the bathrooms with their tongue, throwing a person on the floor and kicking him cruelly in the name of teaching lessons for their wrong doings against the teachings of the church... and also how they tell the members to completely disconnect from their family members who do not believe in the church... all of this has just gave me a very negative opinion on LRH and his church of scientology.</TEXT>

Please help me by giving some suggestions on:

* how to develop this skill 
* what kind of story suits better to be told than to write (if)
* what body language affects people in storytelling process
* how to engage your audience better when you're telling them a story

and anything else that you think would be important for a good story teller.</TEXT>

**Eldorado**

Gaily bedight, 

A gallant knight,

In sunshine and in shadow,

Had journeyed long,

Singing a song,

In search of Eldorado.</TEXT>

        <DOC>

But he grew old-

This knight so bold-

And o'er his heart a shadow

Fell as he found

No spot of ground

That looked like Eldorado.</TEXT>

And, as his strength

Failed him at length,

He met a pilgrim shadow-

"Shadow," said he,

"Where can it be-

This land of Eldorado?"</TEXT>

"Over the Mountains

Of the Moon,

Down the Valley of the Shadow,

Ride, boldly ride,"

The shade replied-

"If you seek for Eldorado!"</TEXT>

And another poem by Edgar Allan Poe has the following lines, which is what interested me to look into Poe in the first place:




*All that we see or seem*

*Is but a dream within a dream.*</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> If you look at *Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban* there is something called as Time Turner which is used by Hermione to attend extra classes, it is also the object which Dumbledore advices Harry to use by the end of the book to travel back in time and set things right.. There is not any explanation given as to the working of time turner itself but the story just carries on with its help and presence.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>So, maybe you can simply come up with something like that and take your story forward.. And also there is a book by Stephen King called *11/22/63* where a teacher travels back in time to stop the assassination of JFK.. I haven't read it yet but you might wanna check that out once.. And most important of all is not what you used to time travel, but how well the plot is woven.. If the story is griping enough, then audience wouldn't care about how it's done.. Didn't you watch Chris Nolan's *Inception* film.. Nobody bothers about what that dream machine was all about but what they do there after entering into the dream realm... So, it depends not on what your character uses to time travel but what he does after time traveling that would interest some category of people, a category that readers like me belong to.</TEXT>

(But I was surprised that in all the three pics I got from people the girl is moving objects vertically above her palms... I was thinking of her moving the objects that are at some distance, like TV remote or books in a shelf, a bottle from the fridge or something like that...)

But thank you so much for the efforts.. the sketch is very nice... actually she is looking more like a normal girl, which is what I wanted, and especially the expression on her face is very good, it almost suits the setting of my story.</TEXT>

Please suggest me books that have:

* Splendidnly well weaved words.. like some very short poetry.. something like Gitanjali.. (I have long poetry books already.. now I'm looking for something like one page long at max)
* Beautiful short musings
* Anything well written that's longer than quotes but shorter than stories, like a couple of pages..
* Short myths kind of stuff may be (short)


Sorry, I'm unable to articulate properly what I want, but I guess you get the idea... 

Please suggest lots and lots of works.. (actually I'm an aspiring writer.. So, I'm exploring the beauty of words to fill my mind with it.</TEXT>

**Do not go gentle into that goodnight** (*don't just give up all hope and die out, which is as easy as going into a good night sleep, only forever*)

**Rage rage, against the dying of the light** (*fight with all your heart, and your soul, and everything that you have, for the light, for a new dawn, for another sunrise, which would be a rebirth to the Mankind*)

That's why it is related to Interstellar.</TEXT>

Most of the times it is film sound tracks.. Hans Zimmer, especially.. I'm from India, so I would like to more names to it: A.R.Rahman, Shankar-Eshaan-Loy, Amit Trivedi etc.. These people's music had influenced my thought process many times and pushed me towards writing something refreshing, which I didn't have in mind moment prior to listening to their music..

However, I don't everytime get influenced by music alone in order to put my thoughts to words.</TEXT>

Talking particularly about *The Giver* the narration seemed a bit different and most of the times very straight not bothering about exploring the feelings of characters in depth, although it helped in keeping the book short, which I like.</TEXT>

By that what I meant is that a person who is reading something that *he* feels is interesting to him has the right to feel the work is worthy of investing his own time and concentration, no matter what other people think about it.. For example, many people criticise Dan Brown and Malcom Gladwell, but both are my favourite Fiction and Non-Fiction authors respectively.</TEXT>

Yes.. I'm not being serious when I say I look down upon them.. I know so many damn interesting people who don't read but are fucikn interesting at their minds... That being said, I belive guess the quote only refers to those people that have the habit of reading and how they, and only they, feel when they don't read for long time..

I loved *Gitanjali*, liked *Of Mice and Men* and disliked *Old Man and the Sea*.. 

I thought it's time I clarify to myself about how Nobels are awarded in Literature category.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_2959_891_0</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> The main thing that drove me and still drives me towards reading more books is *I'm an aspiring writer*.. and to write better you gotta read better and read like hell... So once I tried to take up writing seriously, and as they say *when you pick up one end of the stick you pick up the other end too..*, I had to take reading seriously as well... and that lead me through myriad portals toward the kind of stuff I'm interested to read/write about.. and I kept picking up books.. 

So, that's the most important thing about forming my reading habit.. and also another vital aspect is I was gifted a *Kindle Paperwhite* by my brother-in-law for my birthday around July 2013, and thence my reading habit got redefined :)

And coming to the part of feeling reading as a *chore*: I've a weakness in my mind.. that is when I start reading a book and if I don't feel interested in it or if it felt tough or anything, I simply cannot give up reading it.. I feel defeated by that book when I do that.. I somehow continue it till I end it.. So during such times, yes, reading feels like a chore... In the list I mention in the post, the books that especaily felt like that were: *The Loser* by Peter Ustinov and *Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde by R. L. Stevenson* (I'm trying to fight this weakness, which would help me save time and makes reading not to feel like a chore, at times..)

Rest all were fine, but I obviously didn't like all the books equally... 

So, that's about it :)

Thank you so much for the interest you showed in asking me about my habit forming..</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> I thought that it is such a small book and a classic, too, so I felt happy to pick it up, but, boy, I was so very wrong.. The book is literally unreadable for me :( 

(I'm not native English.. )

Is it only me or is there anybody else out there who felt similar difficulty??</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> First of all, I was expecting great story from the book because of all the hype of it being a classic and all.... and most importantly due to the depressive environment the entire book had bestowed upon me (I must say, in this case the author succeeded in making me feel the Dystopian time completely.. Orwell did great work at that)... So, I guess, I disliked the book mostly because I was expecting lot of great thrilling story from it rather than focusing on the classic idea of privacy invasion.. so that's the reason.</TEXT>

The most interesting part about the book is that both male (Nick) and female (Amy) narrations are great.. The thing that most intrigued me is how well Amy character turned out as the story moved forward.. It evolved very powerfully.</TEXT>

Whatever is explained in there, believe it or not, it sure did change my thought process a couple of years ago, and I'm a person who stronly believes that your thoughts make your life, hence I can happily say that it did bring a great change in my life.

Anyways, talking of poetry, let me confess, I tried reading epic poetry like *Paradise Lost*, but truth be told, I never *understand* anything in those epic poetic lines, but then sometimes among them I used to find some really awesome powerful *quotes* kind-of lines, which made me keep going if only for searching more of such lines.. 

Why I'm telling you all this is because you really seem to have great knowledge on poetry related works (you even mentioned that your academics are related to this field).</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>And to create art, you ought to be *inspired..*  As you're saying that you're interested in writing, I would suggest you to recognize the kind of writing that inspires you... You should take it from the very basic level..

*Start reading quotes*, lots of quotes from lots of authors.. And I'm sure that will inspire you.. and then alongside, think back into your own past experiences that you feel are vital for your life, and try writing small quotes/sentences about them, whatever they would be, just write a sentence about it.</TEXT>

This is what I learned by practicing writing since past 4 years.. I started with writing blogs (began with Blogger, and after all this time, recently switched to Medium.com).. At the begining, my writings had lots of grammatical errors, but after all these years, I'm able to write better, with very less grammatical errors, and above all, with a more inspired spirit in my writing.</TEXT>

There are many instances in the plot that seemed really senseless.. Winston, Julia and O'Brien... there is no proper relation between how they develop their opinions and feelings that they have for one another.. Why Julia loves Winston and a lot more such loose ends..

I have observed the same plot line in very well known classics Fahrenheit 451, 1984, and also a novella Anthem (by Ayn Rand)... 

Now, why is that??</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>But recently, as I started exploring Reddit, I found those subreddits that are very closely related to the kind of erotica I used to read.. and was kinda into them for a couple of days on the weekend.. I broswed through lot of captioned pictures on reddit and some real life stories...

I realized this is wrong too and am again trying to keep myself away from them like I did when started NoFapping a couple of months ago, although I didn't reset my badge right now because I **did not** masturbate at all!!</TEXT>
