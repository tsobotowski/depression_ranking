It's an amazing stand alone game that may have you a bit out in the dark at first with terms and lore, but you should catch on really fast and should be having so much fun during that time (if you're like me) that it isn't too much of a bother to take time to take everything in."</TEXT>

Of course when cable internet was finally offered where I lived I switched to Cox and got a 60/6 (I think 6 up) line, I know the month after I switched I got a letter from Century Link saying they now offered bonded DSL in my area of up to 40 mbps and offered me a discount to go back.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Now I know the common arguments like 

Consoles hold PCs back

Console communities are cancerous (from my experience PC is just as bad, but don't get me wrong they both are really bad with some exceptions)

But some PC gamers hate consoles with such a ferocity it makes me think their PS2 did bad things to them as kids (a joke, no one get too upset).</TEXT>

I guess to add from a console(and on a smaller scale PC gamer) side why I like consoles:

To expand even if someone new was getting into gaming a PS4 slim is 300$ new, most people already have a TV, so besides games you're good to go.</TEXT>

Went in to switch to the One Plus plan (no internet where I live except Sat so the unlimited tethering is enticing ) and  same guy gave me 10$ off that too since I told him I wouldn't do autopay so it sucked I couldn't get the discount.</TEXT>
