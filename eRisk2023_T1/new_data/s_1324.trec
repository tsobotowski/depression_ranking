I was archive binging and read an old review about Clerks and I was surprised that it hadn't occurred to me that its gender politics are kinda questionable, especially since the indie film world that made Kevin Smith's name is so attached to progressives: http://www.avclub.com/article/the-new-cult-canon-iclerksi-2239

Any other movies where you're surprised more people didn't talk about that?</TEXT>

So, which of these approaches would you recommend: 

A. Prolonged POV shots (Not a gopro, I think those tend to shake too much to properly simulate vision) to make it more immersive.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1324_1003_6</DOCNO>

B. With conventional multiple camera setups because then people pay less attention to how the video is being shot and more to the story and acting.</TEXT>
