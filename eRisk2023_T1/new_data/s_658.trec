            	<TEXT>I'll assume man weighs 85kg, the cat weighs 5kg, and the cat fell 2m. We can use this formula to calculate the bodys kinetic energy just before impact: energy = mass \* gravity constant \* height And then this one to calculate the force of impact: force = change in energy % distance travelled Here, the distance travelled is actually the distance travelled after the cat hits the ground (ie smushing that occurs on impact).</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Now we calculate the cat's kinetic energy: E = 5kg \* 9.81 ms-2 \* 2m = 98.1j To get the correct height to drop the boyfriend, we substitute in our new value for E in the equation: 98.1j = 85kg \* 9.81ms-2 \*h And solve for h: h = 98.1/(85 \* 9.81) = 0.11m So smushing aside, you only have to drop the boyfriend off a kerb to get a fall with equivalent energy as the cat since he's so much bigger</TEXT>
