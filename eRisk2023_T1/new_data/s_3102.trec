The main difference between, say, vallejo and craft paint is that the pigment in the vallejo paints is ground down much finer than in the craft paint, and so is less likely to be clumpy or chalky and obscure detail.</TEXT>

Another note, craft paint is totally fine for things like terrain projects, so if you are going to be doing that anyway, might as well start with craft paint on minis, and then just use it for terrain after you upgrade to model paints.</TEXT>
