I boycotted TASM movies because I thought they handled terribly (choosing to reboot the franchise while Spidey 4 was in Pre-production, rushing it into production only 5 years after the last one, choosing a director who was under qualified for the movie, and arrogantly announcing 3 sequels before the 1st one opened).</TEXT>
