            	<TEXT>hello , i streaming for fun sometimes, and i'm trying to get the best quality without lose performance from my hardware... i think i have a good rig anyway , but in some games my 1060 seems struggle to use NVENC with some fps drop in some games who need an high gpu usage... i have also an 8700k... but i hate too see the temperature rise a bit too high when stream with a fast or medium preset (with very fast i think is the same or worse then NVENC) anyway i did some test with nvenc and quicksync and seems very close in quality but in the second case my gpu is totaly free for the game... any suggestion on what is better ?</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>yes i know ... x264 use a lot of cpu resource for encoding, but in my case the question is about the gpu usage about NVENC, it use like 10% of gpu while QSV use the integrated gpu ... then my primary graphic card not have this 10% of more stress... this is right or because use a separate asic the encoding process not count on the effective utilization of my gpu with the game?</TEXT>
