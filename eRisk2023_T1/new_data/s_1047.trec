Never thought about drafting a more flat and value-based curve early in order to fit more curved-out yet quality cards.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> Hmm... I did see him play 2 imp gang bosses and assorted 2-drops which led me to believe he was drafting a more zooish-aggro style deck, but I just consider the likelihood of both drafting and drawing voidcaller coupled with a considerable demon drop to be too low to play around.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Just too much effort goes into letting the warlock keep a 3/4 to trade up or get value out of, but you do make a good point in reading your opponent, will consider it next time I approach a voidcaller.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> Yeah, I feel with the entire randomness with arena what first drafting voidcaller and a big drop demon and having drawn both of them make these kinds of situations unlikely, but they do happen :/

Thanks for the input, probably will try to commit to board with no fear next time</TEXT>
