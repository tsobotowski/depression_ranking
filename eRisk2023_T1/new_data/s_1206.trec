            	<TEXT>I think that album has a time and place, and can't be listened to at any moment like some of their albums


* 2) The Killers - liked them when I was younger, got back into them and I think Sam's Town has aged realllllly well


* 3) Sage Francis - Man did this dude's new album swing hard, wooooo I love his venom


* 4) Modest Mouse - always knew the "hits" but listened to them a bunch more, I really dig the song, "Bankrupt On Selling"

* 5) Gorillaz - listened to the entire Demon Dayz album, and holllly shiiiit, it was gnarly


* 6) Twenty One Pilots - These two dudes have become one of my favorite bands, I think after their 3rd album these guys are gonna explode more than they already have, I'm super looking forward to their next project

* 7) Marina and the Diamonds - I was debating on not putting her on here, primarily because her lyrics aren't great and all that negative connotations that pop music brings, but I'll be damned if I didn't find her so catchy.</TEXT>

*  8) St. Vincent - Digital Witnesses is my favorite song off her latest album, it's a fun album for me


* 9) The Naked   Famous - first heard them in FIFA, I totally dig their style and the female singer is something I totally dig

* 10) Atmosphere - Southsiders had it's moments, not the greatest album, I think I enjoyed it more than most Atmosphere fans.</TEXT>

* Pete Townshend (One of my favorite older rockers with some iconic moves that I love)

* Mike McCready (Pearl Jam's guitarist, I think he's very underrated, probably not top 5 all time, but he's in my list because I just love his solos)

* Jimmy Page (Double neck motha fuckaaaaassssss)

* John Frusciante ( I can't believe I forgot him in my original group :( ... He's literally one of my favorite people on the face of the planet)

If you want to suggest a new album please put it in a format like this:

* Artist
* Album
* Genre

You can suggest as many as albums as you'd like, I'll keep track of it all, but keep it reasonable to albums that you think everyone should hear.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Most notably:
* Korean *miscommunication* about the location of Worlds
* Treatment of Gambit with the London LCS event
* Replay of LCS game because of Aatrox bug

**My thoughts to the problems**

For the first topic, I'm a little bit more forgiving because complications in testing and designing are a necessity when aiming for perfection.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1206_848_18</DOCNO>

            	<DOCNO>s_1206_848_19</DOCNO>

So I think it would take a new MOBA that was as simple as LoL to learn, instilled many of the elements that LoL has, and most importantly, can offer **money** to tournament teams as prize money.</TEXT>

**TL;DR**

* Riot doesn't deliver on promises that are generally advertised earlier
* Riot mishandles professional teams and events
* Riot is obviously still a great company, that has obvious room for improvement
* Would take bookoo bucks to usurp Riot
