Some tips:


- Collect rune talismans for the areas you're roaming (self explanatory why)

- Some of the best loots I've gotten is from searching upstairs where people are trying to hide and wait until their skull is gone, always check around there

- ALWAYS MAKE SURE YOU HAVE INVENTORY ROOM.</TEXT>
