Abstract

 Background: Young children 58 years old with type 1 diabetes (T1D) exhibit clear needs for improved glycemic control but may be limited in their ability to safely interact with an artificial pancreas system.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1828_370_3</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Our goal was to evaluate the safety and performance of an artificial pancreas (AP) system among young children with T1D.

 Research Design and Methods: In a randomized, crossover trial, children with T1D age 58 years were enrolled to receive on separate study periods (in random order) either the UVa AP using the DiAs Control Platform software with child-resistant lock-out screens (followed as an out-patient admission) or their usual insulin pump+continuous glucose monitor (CGM) care at home.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Compared to home care, the AP admission resulted in increased time with blood glucose (BG) 70180mg/dL (73% vs. 47%) and lower mean BG (152mg/dL vs. 190mg/dL), both P0.001 after adjustment for activity.</TEXT>

From the linked university press release article:

 Weathers says the superior performance of DLA in comparison to ACT, as well as its ability to kill drug-resistant parasites and avoid the resistance trap, itself, is likely due to the synergistic effects of a complex array of phytochemicals contained in the plants leaves, several of which are also known to have antimalarial properties and others of which may act both to enhance the absorption of artemisinin into the bloodstream and bolster its effectiveness against malaria.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>In effect, the dried leaves constitute a robust natural combination therapy, one whose benefits far surpass those of ACT and other combination drugs.</TEXT>

EDIT:

For the commenters saying that this is not new because Artemisinin, the drug used in Artemisinin combination therapy (ACT), is derived from Artemisia annua, the issue here is resistance to Artemisinin combination therapy, and the fact that the dried natural leaves of the Artemisia plant appear to have overcome this.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1828_565_21</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

This suggests that there may be something else in the natural leaves of the Artemisia plant that is more than just pure Artemisinin.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1828_565_22</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

From the linked university press release article:

 Weathers says the superior performance of DLA in comparison to ACT, as well as its ability to kill drug-resistant parasites and avoid the resistance trap, itself, is likely due to the synergistic effects of a complex array of phytochemicals contained in the plants leaves, several of which are also known to have antimalarial properties and others of which may act both to enhance the absorption of artemisinin into the bloodstream and bolster its effectiveness against malaria.</TEXT>

Abstract:

 Objective:
 This study compared health care access, utilization, and functional indicators among adults with and without serious psychological distress (SPD) in the years surrounding implementation of the Patient Portable and Affordable Care Act (ACA).</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>

 Methods:
 Adults ages 18 to 64 from the 20062014 National Health Interview Survey (N=207, 853) were examined on 11 access, utilization, and functional indicators: health insurance coverage (health coverage), insufficient money for medications, delay in health care (delay in care), insufficient money for health care, visiting a doctor ten or more times in the past 12 months, change in place of health care, change in place of health care due to insurance, limitations in ability to work, limitations in activities of daily living (ADLs), insufficient money for mental health care, and having seen a mental health care provider.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>

 Results:
 Multivariate models that were adjusted for health coverage and sociodemographic characteristics indicated that compared with adults without SPD, adults with SPD had greater odds of lacking money for medications (AOR=10.0) and health care (AOR=3.1), experiencing delays in care (AOR=2.7), visiting a doctor ten or more times in the past 12 months (AOR=3.2), changing usual place of health care (AOR=1.5), changing usual place of health care because of insurance (AOR=1.5), and experiencing limitations in ADLs (AOR=3.6) and ability to work (AOR=1.8).</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>There was a whole section after it:

 This increase in maternal deaths among women aged 40 and older is implausibly high and rapid, and we believe it has much to do with problems related to how information is collected at the time of death and with an over-reporting of maternal deaths, said Marian MacDorman, a research professor at the MPRC and the studys lead investigator.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1828_993_4</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

 However, even if much of this increase is the result of over-reporting, the researchers core findings represent several reasons for concern: 

 The maternal death rate continues to increase in the United States;
 The U.S. maternal death rate is much higher than in other industrialized countries; and
 The United States lacks a reliable way to collect information about why this is happening and about which segments of the population are most vulnerable   

I copied word for word from the research's core findings which was why it was publishable in the first place, despite the data quality issues, which is not unusual for an administrative dataset which is hard to control for.</TEXT>

Abstract:

 As the adoption of electronic record and health information technology rapidly expands, hospitals and other health providers increasingly suffer from data breaches.1 A data breach is an impermissible use or disclosure that compromises the security or privacy of the protected health information and is commonly caused by a malicious or criminal attack, system glitch, or human error.2,3 Policy makers, hospital administrators, and the public are highly interested in reducing the incidence of data breaches.</TEXT>

Abstract

 Background

 Early-life exposure to household pets has the capacity to reduce risk for overweight and allergic disease, especially following caesarean delivery.</TEXT>

 Results

 Over half of studied infants were exposed to at least one furry pet in the prenatal and/or postnatal periods, of which 8% were exposed in pregnancy alone and 46.8% had exposure during both time periods.</TEXT>

 Conclusions

 The impact of pet ownership varies under different birth scenarios; however, in common, exposure to pets increased the abundance of two bacteria, Ruminococcus and Oscillospira, which have been negatively associated with childhood atopy and obesity.</TEXT>

Abstract:

 Objectives

 A brain electrical activity biomarker for identifying traumatic brain injury (TBI) in emergency department (ED) patients presenting with high Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) after sustaining a head injury has shown promise for objective, rapid triage.</TEXT>

Highlights

Dorsal auditory stream supports auditory working memory manipulation
Theta power and phase locking in the dorsal stream predict manipulation abilities
Rhythmic TMS over the IPS selectively entrains ongoing theta oscillations
TMS-induced behavioral enhancement is causally related to theta entrainment

 Hi mate, I know you posted this around 2 days ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/617w56/millions_of_uk_workers_at_risk_of_being_replaced/

Wait another day, and then repost this - to be fair to the other posters whose posts we have been removing as duplicates - because this latest post is really about the same topic actually.</TEXT>

 Conclusions

 In conclusion, our findings provide evidence that the duration of labor in low-risk nulliparous women may be shortened by a policy of intravenous fluids at a rate of 250 mL/hours rather than 125 mL/hours.</TEXT>

 Aims and Methods:

We analyzed data from the UK Household Longitudinal Survey, involving 30594 people (aged  16) who provided data on sleep and health and well-being at both Wave 1 (20092011) and Wave 4 (20122014) assessments.</TEXT>

Abstract:

 The Ebola virus vaccine strategies evaluated by the World Health Organization in response to the 2014-2016 outbreak in West Africa included a heterologous primary and booster vaccination schedule of the adenovirus type 26 vector vaccine encoding Ebola virus glycoprotein (Ad26.ZEBOV) and the modified vaccinia virus Ankara vector vaccine, encoding glycoproteins from Ebola, Sudan, Marburg, and Tai Forest viruses nucleoprotein (MVA-BN-Filo).</TEXT>

Abstract:

 Introduction

 Although findings concerning sexual outcomes associated with cyberpornography use are mixed, viewing explicit sexual content online is becoming a common activity for an increasing number of individuals.</TEXT>

 Aim

 To investigate heterogeneity in cyberpornography-related sexual outcomes by examining a theoretically and clinically based model suggesting that individuals who spend time viewing online pornography form three distinct profiles (recreational, at-risk, and compulsive) and to examine whether these profiles were associated with sexual well-being, sex, and interpersonal context of pornography use.</TEXT>

 Methods

 The present cluster-analytic study was conducted using a convenience sample of 830 adults who completed online self-reported measurements of cyberpornography use and sexual well-being, which included sexual satisfaction, compulsivity, avoidance, and dysfunction.</TEXT>

Highlights

Army ant-parasitic rove beetles comprise an ancient system of complex convergence
Beetles anatomically mimic and deceive host ants to exploit nest resources
Convergent clades arose in the Cenozoic and share a Cretaceous common ancestor
Convergence over deep time challenges the notion of evolutionary contingency

Summary

 Recent adaptive radiations provide striking examples of convergence [1, 2, 3, 4], but the predictability of evolution over much deeper timescales is controversial, with a scarcity of ancient clades exhibiting repetitive patterns of phenotypic evolution [5, 6].</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Remarkable among these are many species of rove beetle (Staphylinidae) that exhibit ant-mimicking myrmecoid body forms and are behaviorally accepted into their aggressive hosts societies: emigrating with colonies and inhabiting temporary nest bivouacs, grooming and feeding with workers, but also consuming the brood [8, 9, 10, 11].</TEXT>

Highlights

* Memory champions show distributed functional brain network connectivity changes
* Mnemonic strategies for superior memory can be learned by naive subjects
* Mnemonic training induces similarity with memory champion brain connectivity
* Brain network dynamics of this effect differ between task and resting state

Summary

 Memory skills strongly differ across the general population; however, little is known about the brain characteristics supporting superior memory performance.</TEXT>

Abstract:

 Background

 The Physician Payments Sunshine Act, part of the Affordable Care Act, requires pharmaceutical and medical device firms to report payments they make to physicians and, through its Open Payments program, makes this information publicly available.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1828_1683_3</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

 Objective

 To establish estimates of the exposure of the American patient population to physicians who accept industry payments, to compare these population-based estimates to physician-based estimates of industry contact, and to investigate Americans awareness of industry payments.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1828_1683_6</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

 Main Measures

 Respondents contact with physicians reported in Open Payments to have received industry payments; respondents awareness that physicians receive payments from industry and that payment information is publicly available; respondents knowledge of whether their own physician received industry payments.</TEXT>

 Key Results

 Among the 1987 respondents who could be matched to a specific physician, 65% saw a physician who had received an industry payment during the previous 12 months.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1828_1683_8</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>This population-based estimate of exposure to industry contact is much higher than physician-based estimates from the same period, which indicate that 41% of physicians received an industry payment.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1828_1683_9</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Across the six most frequently visited specialties, patient contact with physicians who had received an industry payment ranged from 60 to 85%; the percentage of physicians with industry contact in these specialties was much lower (3556%).</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1828_1683_10</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Only 12% of survey respondents knew that payment information was publicly available, and only 5% knew whether their own doctor had received payments.</TEXT>

 Conclusions

 Patients contact with physicians who receive industry payments is more prevalent than physician-based measures of industry contact would suggest.</TEXT>

Sex Differences in Microglia Activity within the Periaqueductal Gray of the Rat: A Potential Mechanism Driving the Dimorphic Effects of Morphine

H.H. Doyle, L.N. Eidson, D.M. Sinkiewicz and A.Z. Murphy

Journal of Neuroscience 20 February 2017, 2906-16;

Abstract:

 Although morphine remains the primary drug prescribed for alleviation of severe or persistent pain, both preclinical and clinical studies have shown that females require 2-3 times more morphine than males to produce comparable levels of analgesia.</TEXT>

 Methods

 In this proof-of-concept trial (Clinicaltrials.gov #: NCT02229188), individuals with late life depression (LLD) (22; 60+ years old) were randomized to either problem solving therapy (PST, n = 10) or a neurobiologically inspired digital platform designed to enhance cognitive control faculties (Project: EVO, n = 12).</TEXT>

 Methods

 In this proof-of-concept trial (Clinicaltrials.gov #: NCT02229188), individuals with late life depression (LLD) (22; 60+ years old) were randomized to either problem solving therapy (PST, n = 10) or a neurobiologically inspired digital platform designed to enhance cognitive control faculties (Project: EVO, n = 12).</TEXT>

Abstract:

 Although morphine remains the primary drug prescribed for alleviation of severe or persistent pain, both preclinical and clinical studies have shown that females require 2-3 times more morphine than males to produce comparable levels of analgesia.</TEXT>

 Conclusion

 The finding that patients report its use as a substitute for prescription drugs supports prior research on medical cannabis users; however, this study is the first to specify the classes of prescription drugs for which cannabis it is used as a substitute, and to match this substitution to specific diagnostic categories.</TEXT>

 There is more than a 50% probability that by 2030, national female life expectancy will break the 90 year barrier, a level that was deemed unattainable by some at the turn of the 21st century.</TEXT>

This section in the paper about the US is notable:

 The USA has the highest child and maternal mortality, homicide rate, and body-mass index of any high-income country, and was the first of high-income countries to experience a halt or possibly reversal of increase in height in adulthood, which is associated with higher longevity.20, 21, 28, 29, 30 The USA is also the only country in the OECD without universal health coverage, and has the largest share of unmet health-care needs due to financial costs.25 Not only does the USA have high and rising health inequalities, but also life expectancy has stagnated or even declined in some population subgroups.1, 2 Therefore, the poor recent and projected US performance is at least partly due to high and inequitable mortality from chronic diseases and violence, and insufficient and inequitable health care.</TEXT>

Abstract

 Despite the sustained media attention surrounding internet trolling, academic studies investigating its occurrence are rare.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1828_1875_1</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>This study aimed to provide a case study analysis of the behaviours and strategies of a group of alleged Twitter trolls referred to as the anti-McCanns due to their continual abuse of Kate and Gerry McCann as well as those who support them and thus identify as pro-McCann.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1828_1875_2</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>The way in which language was used to construct the anti-McCanns group identity, enhance in-group cohesion and facilitate out-group disassociation from the pro-Mccann group was additionally explored, given that previous research has implicated group processes in the propagation of aggressive online conduct.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1828_1875_3</DOCNO>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1828_1875_4</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>The data was then analysed using quantitative content analysis and discourse analysis, which indicated that language was utilised in a variety of ways by the anti-McCanns to construct a salient group identity and negatively stereotype and disassociate from the pro-McCann group.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1828_1875_5</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Findings additionally revealed that several strategies were employed by the anti-McCann trolls to provoke and derogate members of the pro-McCann group, supporting previous findings which have linked trolling to both western media culture and the characteristics of anti-social personality disorder.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1828_1880_5</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Following prior research and theory, we defined compassionate acts as caregiving that is freely given, focused on understanding and genuine acceptance of the others needs and wishes, and expressed through openness, warmth, and a willingness to put a partners goals ahead of ones own.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1828_1880_7</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Our findings, which controlled for the general affective tone of marital interaction, revealed that compassionate acts are beneficial for both donors and recipients, and that the effects on the donor are stronger than the effects on the recipient.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1828_1880_8</DOCNO>

Abstract:

 Guided by concepts from a relational developmental perspective, this study examined intra- and interpersonal associations between self-esteem and depressive symptoms in a sample of 1,407 couples surveyed annually across 6 years in the Panel Analysis of Intimate Relations and Family Dynamics (pairfam) study.</TEXT>
