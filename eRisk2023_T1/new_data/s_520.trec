-women are victims of acid attacks in many South East Asian nations
and much more

the main reason I don't think we should just hand out the identity, freely because honestly, people treat asexuality as a joke, not because they might not understand it but it's because of the dreaded SJWs and other fake people in this way:
I have seen cases where people claim to be asexual to deny sex (as opposed to just saying no - now I know you will say rape will happen, but it's just gonna get more complicated so it's a completely different discussion).</TEXT>

and yes she has high win rate and high banning status (especially in korea, don't know about NA):
http://www.op.gg/statistics/champion/katarina/

my problem with kat, not that I lost to one, is that she is the reason you cannot just pick any champion into any role and well forces picks (mainly support since the support is required to have CC just so you can stop katarina) where as sometimes I want to support with zilean and karma, for example but cannot.</TEXT>

note: was with anything, there will be exceptions
examples:

1)tattoos:
-if you are getting one to spite or rebel against someone that is not a good reason to get one you might hurt yourself (no longer love yourself)
-you can honor God by getting a tattoo and with right intentions

2) (secular)music:
-songs with positive messages (who says by Selena Gomez, Skyscraper by Demi Lovato), love songs can help you lover yourself or others, your neighbors
-songs that have no meaning but can be fun (anaconda by Nicki Minaj) are just meant to be fun with right intentions
-satanic music cannot be redeemed by God, avoid these

3) homosexuality
-it's the sexual act, not the marriage
-it provides no (evolutionary) advantage, it is meaningless, lust and flesh therefore it is not honorable for God
-STDs, and general sexual consquences

4) Porn
-lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific values, therefore cannot be redeemed for the honor of God

5) Drugs
-obvious
