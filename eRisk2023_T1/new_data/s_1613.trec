If magazine capacity mattered, there would be a strong correlation between mass shooting events, magazines, and number of people killed, but such a correlation is hard to draw, partially because such events are exceedingly rare, and partially because magazine capacity is pretty far down the list of things that enable a mass shooter.</TEXT>

Furthermore, even going with the lowest reasonable estimates of defensive gun uses, which are approximately 100,000 annually, it's clear that the use and ownership of firearms has an overall positive societal impact, and that's even if you manage to completely ignore all of the positives that come with gun ownership and use for recreational and sporting purposes.</TEXT>

Suppressing a rifle while hunting is one thing; the use cases for suppressing pistols are a lot narrower. "</TEXT>

Implementing a similar plan where everyone's ID is marked so that someone who is  looking to sell a gun can learn whether the person they're dealing with is a prohibited person or not would be far more effective, cheaper, and easier to implement than the so-called "universal background check" schemes that have been pushed by the likes of Bloomberg.</TEXT>

Of course, as a supporter of gun control, you're completely  incapable of seeing gun owners as anything other than an adversary to mock and harass, so it wouldn't actually occur to you too treat then as anything other than untrustworthy potential criminals, rather than as people who have a vested interest in reducing violent crime, and who could be allies in achieving that goal.</TEXT>

So, from that standpoint, it's much more advantageous for the NRA to strategically support candidates who are likely to win, even if they aren't the perfect pro-gun candidate, because their support buys a lot of influence and clout, and even if that candidate isn't a fan of gun rights, he's well aware of the fact that NRA support makes it easier for him to win elections.</TEXT>

"Progressives" will always hate gun owners, and it has nothing whatsoever to do with your safe gun handling and everything to do with the philosophical underpinnings of liberal ideology, many of which are informed by the ideals of Marxism (during much of the early 20th century) and Postmodernism (late 20th century to now).</TEXT>

Well, if your default philosophical outlook is informed by the Postmodernist belief that your entire society is wrong about pretty much everything all of the time, and Multiculturalism has trained you to believe that all societies are equal, and that you, as a westerner, cannot possess the ability to reasonably articulate or even form valid criticism of other cultures, it becomes very easy for you to look outside of your own culture to find novel ways to inform your motives for implementing change in your society.

            	<TEXT> From where I sit, the proposal to regulate semi-auto guns under the NFA, or requiring a permit to own one has two long-term goals: to invalidate the Common Usage litmus test spelled out in Heller (after all, if they make it more inconvenient to own a certain class of gun vs. another, most people will default to the easier choice out of sheer convenience.)</TEXT>

They're essentially unconcerned that for that scenario to play out, the entire Bill of Rights would have to be suspended, along with prohibitions on the military operating on US soil, and a whole host of other things that would have to fail in order for such a confiscation to happen.</TEXT>

On top of that, most of the people who make the argument that gun owners can't stand up to the military also hail from the same political viewpoint that has an ardent hatred for the military as well, seeing them as the embodiment of America's crass imperialistic designs.</TEXT>

From where I sit, the people who make this argument don't make it out of any actual practical sense, but engage in it because, frankly, they hate the military and they hate gun owners, and (being too cowardly to take direct action themselves) they would like nothing better than to pit two groups of people they hate against one another.</TEXT>

The article basically showed that while the percentage of households that owned guns was smaller compared to years past, this was due to the fact that the rate of gun owning households growing at a slower rate than the rate of household growth overall.</TEXT>

The upshot of the article was that, even though fewer households have a gun as an overall percentage in years past, there are still record numbers of gun owners overall.</TEXT>

The law outlines a number of exceptions where a transfer can be legally done without having to go through a background check.</TEXT>

Here's the list of exempted transfers straight from the bill:

[QUOTE]3 (b)  EXCEPT AS PROHIBITED BY SECTION 18-12-111, A TRANSFER
4 THAT IS A BONA FIDE GIFT BETWEEN IMMEDIATE FAMILY MEMBERS, WHICH
5 ARE LIMITED TO SPOUSES, PARENTS, CHILDREN, SIBLINGS, GRANDPARENTS,
6 AND GRANDCHILDREN;[/QUOTE]

So, reading through that list of exemptions, it would be legal for me to transfer a gun to my wife for self protection while I'm out of town on a business trip.</TEXT>
