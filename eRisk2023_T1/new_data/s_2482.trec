            	<TEXT> We're still not sure whether the phone Pete's sporting in trailer two is an iPhone 3G or a 3GS ([this](https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelstudios/comments/4qt3qe/peter_parker_has_an_iphone_3g_with_a_cracked/) set photo doesn't do much t'help...), but it occurred t'me today to take a look at what kinda laptop he's working with in the first trailer, [right here at 1:14](https://youtu.be/xrzXIaTt99U?t=1m14s)... Apparently it's not a Microsoft Surface, which I'd previously assumed.</TEXT>

I feel like this is the one that really puts Peter's ingenuity on display; it wasn't a temporary thing 'til he put together the real costume later on, because as far as he was concerned this *was* the real costume, one that he'd committed to incrementally upgrading over time.</TEXT>

So I stupidly decided I was mostly done with Spidey books after *Superior* came to an end, and I'd really like to jump back on board before *Clone Conspiracy* kicks into high gear, so I'm wondering if someone could fill me in on what I missed, post *Spider-Verse*.</TEXT>

I'd really like t'know what's on shelves at the moment in terms of Spider-People, and where those books might've come from or spun out of, which'll make catching up a heckuva lot easier... I won't be offended by the odd spoiler, but keep it to a minimum if possible, right?</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> Hey all,

I currently have the opportunity to acquire a [Mid-2010 White Unibody Polycarbonate Macbook](https://support.apple.com/kb/SP584?locale=en_US) to upgrade and use as a desktop for a relatively decent price, but I have a couple of questions I'd like to get out of the way first.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_2482_600_2</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

1) The most important question concerns noise - I'm coming from a 2013 Macbook Air, which recently failed me, but that device was entirely silent.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_2482_600_3</DOCNO>

            	<DOCNO>s_2482_600_6</DOCNO>

2) Again, although I won't be doing anything too intense, how would the performance compare to my base model Air?</TEXT>

3) I've heard conflicting reports on the amount of RAM the machine in question can utilize.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_2482_600_9</DOCNO>

4) I'm not entirely sold on the white polycarbonate look, and my budget would permit me to purchase some skins and keyboard covers.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_2482_600_11</DOCNO>

I'm not sold on the whole Frost Giant/Malekith team-up; it's absolute **pandering** to otherwise unfamiliar cinema audiences, even though I doubt half of them would have remembered Malekith from his, what, five minutes of screen time in *The Dark World*?</TEXT>

Moving onwards and forwards through the series, so long as it lasts, I'd expect we'll see a wider variety of rogues who haven't yet made a cinematic appearance, and they'll certainly be interesting, but I think the true test of Thor's character development (or lack thereof) will come when her identity is revealed.</TEXT>

If not, that's no problem, but I would like to know if there's a way for me to create a column which feeds me relevant hashtags from a given region; ultimately, I'd like to select:

            	<TEXT> So Reddit, I'm currently operating from a five year old notebook, packing a 1.73GHz Intel Pentium M processor, 512MB of RAM, Intel GMA 900 integrated graphics, and Windows XP Professional SP2.</TEXT>

Thing is, I've grown quite attached to the laptop, and I see no reason to retire it to a lifetime of gathering dust when it's still in such good condition.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>I've been thinking about how I might utilize it, and have come up with a couple of possibilities:

* A network-attached storage server, using FreeNAS in a virtual machine to manage a few terabytes spread across several external HDDs.</TEXT>

I'd also consider adding a distributed computing client to it (such as Folding@Home) and possibly Asterisk, the open source telephony project.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Upgrading the current laptop isn't out of the question, for example maxing out the RAM, installing a low capacity SSD, and possibly adding an external graphics card

Absolutely any advice on achieving/maintaining my desired setup is welcome, as well as tips about what else I might be able to pump out of the machine.</TEXT>
