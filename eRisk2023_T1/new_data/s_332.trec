            	<TEXT> I feel a good solution to this would to be to force New PvP players rank 1-3 perhaps to all play in the same games and not give them an option for hotjoin, unranked and ranked until reaching rank 3, maybe forcing them is a bit much and instead create a seperate queue for only ranks 1-3, this could give people some much needed practice against people who are also new to PvP and eliminates any higher ranked and skilled players from dominating and scaring away the new players.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> So my SO is interested in group sex and i'm not entirely against it myself, but even just the thought of another guy touching my SO makes me angry, like shaking with rage angry, and even if she jokingly says something about another guy to purposely annoy me it REALLY pisses me off.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> I feel like this system could be easily abused, what if there was multiple scouts on one map by multiple i mean like 30, what if some player just likes making random markers at places for no actual reason, it is a tough issue to solve.</TEXT>

I was thinking something like the commander tag, but for scouts, the tag allows their text in map chat to show up in a different colour to the others, a scout tag, it would also allow people to see which towers have scouts, due to it showing up on the map much like the commander tag, not sure of the pricing of this tag tho, maybe 100g like the old commander tag?</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> Basically i'm in a foundation year of an engineering course at the moment and i'm really, really struggling with all the maths and i'm dying to do some practical work and actually learn something, all this maths just seems like it's a waste of time and leading to nowhere, i feel like i'm probably going to fail this course, but the thing is i really enjoy the idea of engineering, fixing things particularly, is there a course out there that judges you based on practicals rather than maths tests?</TEXT>

I've thought about apprenticeships and gaining experience through work but i have no idea where to start, i'm young and have never had a job, but i really want this to work also i'm in the UK so if you can point me in the right direction on where to start looking that would be fantastic, i just feel all a bit lost at the moment.</TEXT>
