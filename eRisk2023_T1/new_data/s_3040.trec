            	<DOCNO>s_3040_16_1</DOCNO>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_3040_16_2</DOCNO>

            	<DOCNO>s_3040_16_3</DOCNO>

The veggies:
1 cup each frozen cauliflower florets and sliced carrots (again, frozen is all I have right now)
2 tbl curry powder
Salt to taste
~1 tbl vegetable oil, to drizzle on top

Spread the veggies evenly on a baking dish
Sprinkle curry powder and salt on top, mix to coat
Drizzle oil on top
Roast in a 425 oven for 25 minutes

The rice/sauce:
1 cup rice (before cooking) + water to cover one inch above
1/4 stick butter
Flour (sorry, I have no idea how much)
~1/4 cup curry powder
Water
Salt and red pepper flake to taste

Cook the rice as directed (I did it in the microwave because I'm lazy and made this at 5am)
In a saucepan, melt the butter.</TEXT>
