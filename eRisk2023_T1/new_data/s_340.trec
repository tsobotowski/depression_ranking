So I don't see the nature of any particular human relationship as a basis for establishing ethical status for any particular entity; to me, its relevance to ethics is only in its utility for humans as a means of investigating which phenomena indicate the presence of another entity with subjective experiences that are good and bad (from that entity's perspective).</TEXT>

if that person understands that the actual finding always specifies a specific location - and must do so, because oxytocin's role can only be understood in relation to what it is doing and where.</TEXT>

That 10.7% figure is a misinterpretation; here it is in context, from the abstract of citation 7:

Resting energy expenditure during the last 30 min was 4.5+/-2.5% higher in the placebo trial and 10.7+/-2.5% higher (P0.05) in the caffeine/ephedra trial

psilocybin affects the levels at least three known neurotransmitters (and probably a host of unknown ones) that can be adversely affected following a withdrawal

and therefore

Abruptly stopping a microdosing regimen of psilocybin will almost certainly have ill effects.</TEXT>

That conclusion can't possibly follow from the argument, as all kinds of substances that affect those neurotransmitters *do not* produce withdrawal at arbitrarily low doses.</TEXT>

From the first study linked: 

Prior studies of marijuana smokers have demonstrated consistent evidence of airway mucosal injury and inflammation as well as increased respiratory symptoms such as cough, phlegm production, and wheeze, similar to that seen in tobacco smokers

It seems that the authors of the study you linked believe that marijuana smoking is harmful to the lungs in a way that's comparable to tobacco in the short-medium term.</TEXT>
