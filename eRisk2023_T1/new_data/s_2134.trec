Most of the recipes have fewer than 15 ingredients total, and they cover your basics: protein, carbs, fats, vitamins, minerals

The fewer the total ingredients, the better **$/day** (generally)

My goal is to start with a fairly basic recipe just to start out and then find some decent flavors to work in.</TEXT>

As I understand it, and this is purely speculation on my part, for viruses that have a habit of mutating rapidly (HIV, ebola), or other viruses where a seasonal variant can be very different year to year (influenza): while their exterior structures will change a lot making it difficult for our immune systems to detect or remember them, sometimes they possess a common trait across their various mutations.</TEXT>

So, live virus might be very important for some aspect of research related to making a universal ebola vaccine, but it might be easier to expedite treatments that target the characteristics that are subject to change (this is risky though, as you could end up with something completely ineffective...)

That being said, in that talk by Seth Berkley, he explains why it would never be possible to use a strategy like this for influenza with our current process involving making the vaccine in chicken eggs.</TEXT>

The real problem, as farmer Bill Gehl, chairperson of the Canadian Wheat Board Alliance, a group representing farmers who tried to save the board, said last November is that without the farmer-controlled single-desk Wheat Board, nobody is coordinating grain sales, transportation logistics, and the efficient use of port terminal facilities.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_2134_581_4</DOCNO>

That, in turn means port terminals are now competing with each other to use rail transport capacity just to generate grain handling revenue.</TEXT>

The result is they do not always have the right grade and type of grain in place so ships either cannot get a full load at one terminal, as they could when our Wheat Board arranged deliveries, or ships have to wait for more of the correct grade and type of grain to arrive, Mr. Gehl said.</TEXT>

No, but the Bank of Canada is an independent body, and as per the article, it's very unconventional for the finance minister to make any statements regarding interest rates, which are the sole purview of the Governor of the BoC.

Personally, I think if Canada pioneered a position where personal and corporate income taxes were nullified in place of taxes on environmental impact, I think it could:

* a) Spur some really interesting engineering innovation to lower emissions
* b) Attract a lot of new business, since corporate income taxes would be much lower than other countries

The only problem would be that as such innovations occurred, national revenue would gradually decrease, and there would be a structural deficit driven by green-innovations...

Also, finding ways to balance the new tax code such that existing operations weren't suddenly swamped in new environmental taxes.</TEXT>

Annually, a private citizen is [restricted to $1100](http://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=res dir=ces document=part3 lang=e#36) in total contributions to a political party...

/u/Broseidon241 also makes a really good point on the [prohibition of gifts and other benefits](http://www.reddit.com/r/CanadaPolitics/comments/1edzk5/pms_chief_of_staff_paid_off_mike_duffy_senate/c9zfoe4)

Wright should be restricted in gifting that much money to help his party, and Duffy should be restricted from accepting it.</TEXT>

In all seriousness though, I'm just saying that if the total annual budget for federal research funding remains the same, or is reduced, and at the same time the NRC executive is directed to more strategically direct funding towards 'economically viable research', then some pure research that might have traditionally been granted funding won't occur.</TEXT>

If the reality is that that communication has to be done through the media, rather than less-sensitive back-channels, it ought to be accepted, because the greater harm to the public is in withholding information, and the greater robustness of the political system is in receiving genuine criticism, even from gov't employees (which is probably even more valuable since it's less politically motivated than something coming from the opposition in question period).</TEXT>

However, I think if we're going to employ scientists directly (as opposed to research at a university for instance, where researchers are still funded by the gov't typically, but not directly employed by them) they shouldn't be more restricted than non-gov't researchers in their communications, i.e. peer review, unless it's classified military research (i.e. defence and weapons, etc.).</TEXT>

In the same vein, using the tax system to deliver the supplement is a great idea because it will reduce administrative costs and, hopefully, a lot of confusion while increasing the respect of the individuals by not "othering" them into a seperate system from "regular" Canadians.</TEXT>

As for whether the sale of the LCBO~~/beer-store~~ would increase government revenue, I mentioned these possibilities:

 If the LCBO and beer store were sold off, the initial revenues of the sale and the economic boost of new companies entering the market may actually increase provincial revenues in the long term (the effects should be predictable, however, for whatever policy is better I think).</TEXT>

Monopolizing alcohol distribution puts ~~inherant restrictions on the varieties of beers and liquors and spirits that can be marketed~~ (**Edit:** Apparently overall variety can be measurably higher under a public system, I was considering more small businesses with more niche selections, but that result isn't necessarily a foregone conclusion of privatization).</TEXT>
