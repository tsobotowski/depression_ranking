            	<TEXT>So I've really enjoyed the single band games like Guitar Hero Metallica and The Beatles Rock Band, and now that Rock Band 4 is pretty much the last Rock Band game for a while, it's pretty safe to say that they won't release stand alone games like Green Day or Van Halen.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>It should still be optional to just get the one or two songs as individual songs, but being able to play a new campaign like many other games do would, at least in my opinion, would make the game even more fun.</TEXT>
