I also used to be in the "mexicans are the same as americans" because for 10 years my main guitar was a mexican telecaster, but the moment I got the american stratocaster (and it was second hand from 99, while my tele was from 05, and dont start with the "uff the good mexicans are from 07 to 12" or whatever mythical stuff people say), the differences were HUGE.</TEXT>

So instead of complaining about the EU and the fact that they never understood the problem (when the french knew there was a problem before you did, and that's why they banned east europe migration for a set of years), you should really study the matter, and wonder why the UK never used any of the mechanisms it could use.</TEXT>

As said, I am sending the commands from a Python script, where for example I have a function called "activate all", that will send 25 commands like "A0 P1 S500\n" (obviously with different values after the A and the P) to the serial port.</TEXT>

This works as expected for a while, but after some point, when I send an activate_all, it will indeed activate all of them, but it activates each PWM signal one by one, with a delay of around 1 second between activations (so you can clearly see them going one by one), and a very similar effect when disabling them all.</TEXT>

So the user will do for example a lopp that repeats itself 20 times, where it will activate_all, wait 1 second, disable_all, wait 1 second.</TEXT>

Things I have done: playing with the pot in the pololu driver, changing ALL the electronics (complete new set of arduino ramps and 4 new stepper drivers), new Y endstop (in case it was activating randomly), repath all the cables to make sure nothing pushes the Y end stop, put a new Y stepper motor, slowed down the print to 60%, try new firmwares, and play with the parameters.</TEXT>

The only thing that is left is to change the linear bearing in the Y axis, but if it was a bearing problem, I suppose it would be more constant, not only at the start of a layer, maybe once or twice per print.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_738_1967_19</DOCNO>

            	<TEXT>The second one is Choice Reaction Time (CRT) This means, not only how fast your nerve system reactions to something, but also how fast that reaction is analysed, and your brain and body outputs a good choice.</TEXT>

When tests about reaction time are done, they almost always focus on SRT, where they do tests like this: http://getyourwebsitehere.com/jswb/rttest01.html I think it is obvious that this simple test cannot be really extrapolated to the complexity of a videogame.</TEXT>
