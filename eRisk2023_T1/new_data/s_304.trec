As for your "Taqiyyah" comment, all I say is that our scholars don't go full lunatic and try to escape in women's clothing on broad daylight like Mullah Abdul Aziz here

Right...Because some random Imam at a Masjid from Pakistan attempting to save his life has just as much relevance to my *religion* as the fact that your *religion* is based on telling lies right down to your fundamental books of ahadith, to the extent that your major modern scholars [don't even cover it up anymore](http://arabic.al-khoei.org/falea.htm)...

            	<TEXT> Hey there

I don't know what exactly you're looking for, but here's a Google search of a pretty useful English Academic Islamic website on the topic of Moses

https://www.google.com/search?q=moses btnG=Search domains=www.islamic-awareness.org sitesearch=www.islamic-awareness.org

As far as the Biblical and Islamic accounts, they aren't exactly identical - and the Islamic account is nowhere near as detailed with specifics.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>The Qur'an has a very limited focus on stories and the idea is that the past stories included in the Qur'an were mentioned because of direct benefit to be drawn from them.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_304_520_2</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>So coming from a Christian background, when you read an exclusively Islamic account of - say Moses - it'll feel like a Sparknotes version.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_304_520_3</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Islamic texts neither confirm, nor deny, many aspects of these older stories - or the talmudic/church interpretations of them.</TEXT>

If you look up tafseer (interpretation) of Qur'an, you'll note that scholars will often use what Muslims call 'Israeliyyat' (stories of the Tribe of Israel) that Muslims inherited from Christians and Jews to supplement the information explicitly found in Muslim sources (Qur'an and hadith).</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_304_520_5</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>And the Muslim treatment of these stories is:

(a) if a detail is confirmed in the Qur'an/Ahadith, then the preceding detail is accepted as true.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_304_520_6</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>
(b) if the detail is contradicted by Qur'an/Ahadith, then the Islamic narrative trumps preceding narrative.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_304_520_7</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>
(c) if the detail has no testimony whatsoever in Qur'an/Ahadith, then the Muslim stance is neither to accept nor reject it's veracity.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_304_520_8</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

This might be especially useful to you however since Israeliyyat aren't necessarily just what you find in tanakh or even mishnah, or presently existing non-canonical texts.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_304_520_9</DOCNO>

            	<TEXT>So if you have access to a library with a volume of an English translation of tarikh at-Tabari (History [of the World] by al-Tabari), then you'll have an even greater volume of information on Moses stories that were known as late as about 800 AD (but the veracity of which can't be established without further research of course).</TEXT>

Re:Pantheism's expression in Sikhism -India already had a Pantheistic tradition as you know and Muslims/Hindus living far closer than in other areas Muslims occupied - so it would make sense to me that Guru Nanak Gee would've taken some of the ideas from the ancient traditions preserved by Hinduism and incorporated them in Islamic philosophy - then again, we probably have a fundamentally different understanding of what Guru Nanak Gee was accomplishing.</TEXT>

And again, you seem to be ignoring the footnote of the source you provided

We must be reading something different, in both footnotes, the editor is affirming that the world is divided amongst those who acknowledge their wilayah and those who reject it...it's not saying that he isn't actively doing the division himself of the people into the places - just explaining what the division is about...

and it's a pretty terrible translation of al-Kafi.</TEXT>

Or even Ibn Abi al-Hadeed stated in Sharh Nahaj al-Balagha, Volume 8 page 237:

Right...Because a reference to a late religious commentary by a Mutazili Shi'ite scholar, on a Shi'ite religious book - that has no asl for half the narrations it contains with a sanad in any reputable religious text of Sunnis or Shi'ites - is a great basis for **a historical claim**...

Finally, if At-Tusi was such an evil man as per this fairy-tale of an allegation, ibn Khaldun wouldn't have ever studied at-Tusi's famous works.</TEXT>

- When you (falsely) criticize r/worldnews and somebody accuses you of using an isolated example to cast doubt on the credibility of the mods at r/worldnews and their commitment to the free flow of information - you can also link them to the above sub rather than digging for other (false) pieces of evidence.</TEXT>

##Examples of what brought this on below:


Israeli Terrorists set fire to Mosque in Palestine (removed under the pretense of being in the wrong sub, should be in the country-specific subs and for being "local crime")

http://np.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/2j8ak5/jewish_settlers_set_fire_to_mosque_in_palestinian/

If you're thinking about lending, start here:

[/r/Loans Wiki](http://www.reddit.com/r/Loans/wiki/index)

The META posts in particular provide great information.</TEXT>

###Social Media Verification

If they don't have social media, particularly Facebook, or they do and it's basically never been used, has barely any friends or has a ton of spam-account friends, or seems to have been made overnight, that's a red flag.</TEXT>

###Personal Image Verification

When you ask for images (proof of employment, drivers license, and so forth) ask for all of the following:

(1) Photo ID Close-up

(2) Proof of Employment Document

(3) Borrower holding photo ID

(4) Borrower holding a notecard w/ their Reddit username and date

(5) Borrower making a unique physical gesture

You obviously need to make sure the photo ID matches the name they're claiming and that the person in the photo ID has an uncanny resemblance to the person holding the ID.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>

An image of the individual holding a notecard or something to that effect with their username and the date (4) can be combined with also ask the user to make a unique hand gesture or to hold the card in a unique way *that only you* ask *your* borrowers.</TEXT>

The process of ensuring PayPal verification is simple enough.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_304_1293_24</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>Take the PayPal email address they've provided you and replace the portion with brackets ([email]) in the following URL:

https://www.paypal.com/verified/pal=[email]


###Phone Verification

(1) Once you've gotten their phone number, **have them leave you a voicemail**.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_304_1293_25</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>If they don't use the phone number they provided you to begin with - that's a big red flag.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_304_1293_26</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>They provided you with a bad initial phone number for a reason.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_304_1293_27</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

(2) Next, check the phone number they've provided you against the following site (or an alternative carrier lookup):

[Free Carrier Lookup](http://www.freecarrierlookup.com/)

Again, if it comes back as a strange carrier or VOIP number, that's another red flag.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_304_1293_28</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>They're not providing you their physical/regular phone number for a reason.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_304_1293_29</DOCNO>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_304_1349_4</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>But I do believe BTC has a future where it's primary purpose will return to being a cyber-currency that people use for more than CE.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_304_1349_5</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Anyways, one of the major problems with using BTC has been a lack of protection for your BTC.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_304_1349_6</DOCNO>

            	<DOCNO>s_304_1349_9</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

The idea here is to have a pool of BTC that is used to (a) ensure that businesses that get on board adhere to particular security standards and (b) insure BTC used in transactions with said companies.</TEXT>
