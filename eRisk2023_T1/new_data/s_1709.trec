            	<TEXT> I myself still have a flip phone, but I think Snapchat will be huge, and here are many reasons:

NYT: http://investors.nytco.com/press/press-releases/press-release-details/2017/The-New-York-Times-Announces-Upcoming-Launch-on-Snapchat-Discover/default.aspx

WaPo: http://fortune.com/2017/02/13/washington-post-snapchat/

And here are some recent articles with some different views, which I agree with.</TEXT>

I also predict that Spectacles will be huge; the demand shown on eBay and the prices paid for them is just one reason I say that: While I dn't know how many were purchases from the "Snapbots," you can see that over 5,000 pairs have been sold in the past 90 days, and here they are, in descending price order, with 54 being bought for between $500-599, and another 106 being bought for between $400-499:

There's a missing parameter here: the number of recharge cycles a battery can have without losing large capacity , because over the long term - decades, like done in this business, that's what determines the cost per kwh charge stored and supplied, i.e. what end users pay for.</TEXT>

Without those numbers, it's not possibe to judge Tesla against the competition, for example Alevo, which claims more the 50,000 charge cycles, vs ,i believe, 5000 charge cycles for Tesla.</TEXT>

For Alevo, the final cost per store/supplied should be ~3cents/kwh, over 20 earss lifespan, which should make grid storage very economical.</TEXT>

*And another commenter responded:*

$0.03/kWh delivered is an order of magnitude less than current lithium ion systems which ranges $0.285/kWh - $0.581/kWh delivered to the grid after storage. [</TEXT>

Since the data going into Lazard's models are probably at least more than a year old, I wouldn't be surprised if its currently $0.15-$0.30/kWh to store and then deliver a kWh of electricity.</TEXT>

The largest price difference in Southern California Edison's time-of-use tiers is from $0.11/kWh to $0.47/kWh, so I expect that the systems that Southern California Edison is currently installing are fairly cost efficient for them.</TEXT>

If Alevo can actually deliver at $0.03/kWh at scale (and personally I'm skeptical of something that sounds so good), then that's game over for all fossil fuels and nuclear on the electrical grid.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>There are 3 ways to make money from the Internet: 

- the 1st is by hosting ads, which is what virtually every website does, and that's how Google totally re-defined the global economy in the early 2000s (the company IPO'd as NASDAQ:GOOG in August 2004); ads are also the basis of Facebook's business, of course (NASDAQ:FB)

- the 2nd is by selling access or special features of a site or app (paid apps, paywalled news websites)

- the 3rd is by selling a product or service to people, and using the website as a store (Amazon, Ebay, Zazzle, and countless T-shirt selling websites) 

- and the 4th is by begging users to donate (as Wikipedia does)

The approach that most companies take is "U.R.L" - "Ubiquity (or Users) first, Revenue Later."</TEXT>

It was acknowledged by Ron Paul in 2008 and 2012, and by Trump many times early in his current campaign, that if you run as a third party, the national two-party duopoly makes it so incredibly difficult to get press coverage (in whatever form), get included in a single debate or forum with a major candidate, and get on ballots--but the lack of press coverage is the most devastating preventative measure taken against them, as TV, [Yahoo](http://www.ebizmba.com/articles/news-websites), and Facebook (with its cleverly manipulated Twitter-like "Trending" sidebar) are where the America masses, from coast to coast, find out about anything or anyone.</TEXT>
