            	<TEXT> just as a general note to folks going "UGH WHY DIDNT SHE JUST BLOCK HIM IN THE FIRST PLACE"

she didn't because 

* 1) they had a mutual friend, 

* 2) he messaged her with the pretense of honest intentions (questions about a university she had previously attended), and 

* 3) she is a good person who understands that folks sometimes have difficulty communicating with other people.</TEXT>
