If you can make out the white characters, it appears to say something along the lines of "Executive Producers - Benjamin Melniker and Michael E. Uslan"

I believe this is a possible hint towards the identity of two of the executive producers who worked on the movie, one of which is Michael E. Uslan.</TEXT>

Some explanation:
-Deliberately didn't max some skills
-Muscle Memory to 5/5 (just for a bit of extra damage)
-Delusion to 3/3 (just for a bit of a boost of stamina + dialogue options)
-Not interested in using bombs, I'd rather stick to a signs build if bombs are necessary for an Alchemy build to work
-Would place Synergy with a strong red mutagen
-Rage management to help keep Quen up
-Skipped delayed recovery as potions should already last a long time
-Refreshment I'm on the fence about as Swallow already will last a long time with this build
-Frenzy just sounds obnoxious to use, so I skipped it
-Oils seems good all round, but I'm skipping the last skill because I feel like my adrenaline will be used for the occasional sign due to my playstyle.</TEXT>

In fact, I would not be surprised if this exact angle is exactly what the Defense Attorney was discussing in this quote here:
"When we saw the first video **[I believe he is referring to the one you linked]**, it could have been interpreted in a different way, but after looking at other videos **[this is referring to OPs video, which was considered vital to getting a proper interpretation of events]** and putting it all together, I think we must be careful not to take a decision too quickly," Vaillancourt said."</TEXT>

-Development costs of the DRM: $500
-Lost sales due to customers disliking DRM: $250
-DLC sales lost from unhappy customers: $100
-People returning the game because DRM prevents if from playing: $100
Loss: $950

However, by preventing the game from being torrentable immediately, a small fraction of people who were on the fence about torrenting vs buying now cave in and buy the game.</TEXT>

Imagine:

**The Time Saver**

* +35% load time on the Steam store

* -15% quality of images


**The Merchant's Monocle**

* 5% better prices on the Steam market

* Maximum of 10 market purchases allowed a day


**Santa's Christmas Hat**

* +40% chance to receive drops while browsing the Steam store or playing Steam games during Christmas Day

* -75% relationship with your family


I for one think it would be an amazingly profitable venture for Steam, as well as benefiting all Steam users who can now play games as they please.</TEXT>

I've been watching a lot of older sci-fi and it all seems very twist heavy, and it got me thinking, how surprising where the twists when they first appeared in cinema?</TEXT>

Some specific examples I'm interested in - were most people surprised by the twists in:

* Planet of the Apes
* In general, The Twilight Zone
* Hitchcock's Psycho
* Soylent Green
* Invasion of the Body Snatchers (haven't seen original, but I'm referencing the end of the 1978 version where it leads you to believe he is human trying to fit in, but is actually 'snatched')
* That one dude being a robot in Alien (forgot his name)</TEXT>

**Pricing Model:** Any

**Favorite Features:** Engaging combat - the more skill based the better, smooth and 'flowing' combat (for comparison, WoW and Star Trek's ground combat feel pretty 'clunky'), good ping on Oceanic servers for Australians a plus

**Combat Type**: Any

**Released or Upcoming:** Either, preferably upcoming

For example, in "Death Wish" we see Quinn actually transport Voyager to the time of the big bang (and, if I recall correctly, they were 'outside' of it witnessing it, which means Q's powers transcend the very reality they were originally a species of), could will people in and out of existence and all other matter of seemingly omnipotent feats.</TEXT>

However, in The Q and the Grey, the Voyager crew use the Q weapons against the Q, implying that the most powerful tools available to the Q are independent of themselves (not innate, like a God) and can be interacted with by any physical being.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1418_1590_10</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

2) Where are these weapons/tools located?</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1418_1590_11</DOCNO>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1418_1590_12</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

4) Are the Q physical entities using these weapons from a remote location, or have they 'transcended' beyond physical form?</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1418_1590_13</DOCNO>

I'm sure a lot of these questions are unanswerable, but the Q were always one of my favorite species and I hated the treatment they got on Voyager and thought maybe there's some canonical explanations I've overlooked for some of these questions.</TEXT>

Ticket sales are obviously a huge source of revenue for tournament organizers, so I imagine a lot of this drama would end if Valve were to be a bit harsher on organizers mishandling tournaments.</TEXT>

For fun, some more examples:

Weaver: Lowest HP on timelapse

Pudge: Best Hook Hit to Miss Ratio (must throw at least 15 hooks in the game), Most Self Denies

Bounty Hunter: Most track gold

General: Most Kills, Assists, Roshan's, wards placed, etc in a single game, quickest time to hit level 25, least kills in a game you won, Most last hits in first x minutes of game, quickest time to take a tower, quickest time to win a game

and so on.</TEXT>
