            	<TEXT>Yes, there may be more diversity when allowing cattle to graze on uncultivated grasslands, but it comes at a far larger cost of land, and [higher greenhouse gas emissions](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2535638/):

Adding the carbon debt resulting from the additional cleared land required by the two-thirds less efficient grass finishing process (26.6 million acres  10,400 lb/acre/year, or 276.6 billion lb/year) results in the organic system totaling 770 billion lb of CO2-equivalent GHG emissions; or 58% higher than the conventional systems total of 487.5 billion lb.</TEXT>

According to the [American Dietetic Association](http://www.eatright.org/WorkArea//DownloadAsset.aspx?id=8417):

It is the position of the American Dietetic Association that appropriately planned vegetarian diets, including total vegetarian or vegan diets, are healthful, nutritionally adequate, and may provide health benefits in the prevention and treatment of certain diseases.</TEXT>

**Design:** This was a secondary analysis from a trial in which exclusively breastfed infants (56 mo old from the Denver, CO, metro area) were randomly assigned to receive commercially available pureed meats (Meat group; n = 14) or infant cereal (Cereal group; n = 28) as their primary complementary feedings for 5 mo.</TEXT>

**Background:** High intake of cow-milk protein in formula-fed infants is associated with higher weight gain and increased adiposity, which have led to recommendations to limit protein intake in later infancy.</TEXT>
