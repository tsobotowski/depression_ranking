the nemoidian talking to grievous doesnt have a bad asian accent like in episode one, also I recall the one in episode two didnt have it either, you cant say lucas didnt try to improve 

obi wan and anakin take out an elevator full of droids, anakin seems like his powers have indeed doubled 

anakin and obi wans bickering seems also to have matured, they really are more like brothers now

lol at the rivalry between obi wan and anakin about r2 and implicitly r4

three way fight with dooku begins, much has been said about spinning and jumping shit, but there is real weight and tension in each attack here

lol the extra reason for anakin not to kill dooku came after he killed him, so hes needing less reason to kill.</TEXT>

I thought anakins outfit was black but now I think it might be more of a dark brown, if so, a nice progression from light to semi dark to dark

classic side of ship to side of ship firing, but in space

I cant help but wonder what dooku's republic wouldve looked like, he knew the corruption in the senate and jedi council to an extent but also fought as a sith

grievous looks amazing

"youre a lot shorter than I expected," "jedi scum", the humor without jar jar is just the right tone 

love how the good guys keep getting captured

those roman sentry droids look cool

anakin trying to land says "extend all flaps and drag fins", lucas' love of flying is showing 

sheev looks actually worried hes going to die lol

the problem qui gon had reacting to the green screen during the fish attack in episode one doesnt look like a problem anymore during the landing with anakin and obi 

great shot of ani and obi getting close to camera as they land

coruscant still looks amazing

its shameful how manipulated the jedi council was by sheev

sam jackson needs to say motherfucker once and id be complete

padme rocking the buns, so much hotter than leia

hes eventually happy but i wonder why ani hesitates when padme says shes pregnant

coruscant at night is blade runnerish

love john williams music from start to finish in all the movies

dayum, hayden without his shirt, has filled out nicely

padme's apartment seems to have the best view of all of coruscant 

ani is revealing his premonition to padme and hayden is acting circles around natalie

seeing the jedi temple reminded me of a thought from episode 2, the youngling who gives the answer to where kamino is looks like the same youngling anakin kills at the end 

aang from avatar goes through same dilemma as ani when theyre told to let go of love, here it's clearly an either or situation, I forget how avatar resolved it but he did end up happily with katara and his powers didnt suffer

palpatine gets granted more emergency powers to fight the war, reminds me of bush

obi warns ani to beware palpatine and in next scene, palpatine says trust me, he mustve sensed ani's doubt 

sheev putting anakin on the council is a masterful move and so is the council asking ani to be a double agent, poor ani, much tragedy

ani takes the request and everything personally, obi reminds him it's not him asking, I seem to remember maybe in the clone war series there was an answer to this dilemma of balancing love and the force

ani's being sweet apologizing to obi for his arrogance, and obi is very generous with his praise of anakin, it's nice to see anakin's at times still a good guy

nice to see clones show personality in banter with obi as on the clone wars show

lucas gets knocked for his dialogue but padme promising ani she wont die in childbirth and ani responding with "no, I promise you" is perfect 

utapau looks part amazing, part too much cg like geonosis

windu says if they destroy sheev, theyll have to take control of the govt to ensure a peaceful transition, yoda says "to a dark place this line of thought takes us," which raises an interesting dilemma, do the jedi have to become more like the sith to defeat them?</TEXT>

ani's dialogue about pledging himself is rushed, but hayden does a great job of selling it 

sheev knows he still has to convince ani to do his bidding, makes a seductive argument about having to eliminate to jedi to prevent a civil war 

the killing of the tusken raiders' children was a nice setup for the killing of the younglings at the temple

obi goes to padme to find out where ani's gone, so he knew they were lovers but hadnt said anything

obi now stowing away on padme's ship, hes becoming more like qui gon, using deceit when needed, maybe qui gon (and mace, not like the jedi hadnt killed before) was on to something, not being so rigid in dogma as the jedi had become 

the viceroy is trying to tell ani the truth, that hes been working with sheev, but ani is too far gone and kills him

I love padme taking a moment before confronting ani, it's a nice moment alone with her

portman runs to ani, not really something a pregnant woman would do

lol ani smirks big time when padme says obi wants to help them, he really thinks hes all powerful and doesnt need any help

padme says let's run away and ani gives his "I am the one who knocks" speech

wow ani was going to overthrow sheev and I think he couldve but then he got fucked up by obi

ani and padme are acting great here

uh oh, ani just hit the computer, love how elaborate the action set pieces are

yoda repels sheev's blast and sends them both falling but only yoda falls, it's almost as if it was fate that decided which would win

I still think yoda shouldve beaten sheev but I guess then thered be no ot

it bugs me during the heavy cg scenes when they at least dont use real foreground material

volcano going off around them looks epic

I remember yoda doing a bruce lee like wipe of his nose either vs dooku or sheev but I havent seen it on the blu ray, wonder if they changed this along with puppet yoda

cool to see organa getting screen time

obi ani fight is crazy, theyre trying to kill each other while on a floating antenna on a river of lava 

obi makes a good point when he says ani is lost, though the jedi are far from perfect, theres a clear distinction between them and the sith

obi looks like hes holding in a smile after he cuts off ani's legs

ani rocking those darth maul eyes 

obi not saving ani, he knows ani is still dangerous, nice that they didnt make it so he was cold hearted

obi comes back to the ship, c3po freaking out, obi gives him a comforting tap on the shoulder when hes the one who just nearly killed his friend and brother, what a good dude

sheev actually touches ani and looks like hes giving him comfort, well he is a master manipulator and politician and wants ani to live as his apprentice, contrast that with obi's reason for his comforting touch to c3 and padme

asteroid they're hiding on looks amazing 

nice parallel with padme giving birth while ani undergoing his operation, padme dies while vader and the twins are born

obi didnt tell padme what he did to ani before she lost her will to live so perhaps she sensed it through the force somehow

oohbah oohbah...

the scars on ani are pretty gnarly

til the end, padme believed in ani and said to obi there was good in him, I wonder how much that affected how he dealt with Luke in new hope

sheev tells ani he killed padme in his anger, ani says she couldve have, he felt she was alive, but what choice does he have but to believe the emperor at this point?</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> still, his "no" comes too fast and is still cringeworthy

room where organa, obi and yoda convene looks like from an 80s video game but hey it's a real set

yoda tells obi he will teach him how to commune with qui gon, that hes mastered immortality, pretty awesome that qui gon mastered immortality first, the true way, unlike sheev's way, and it makes sense qui gon was the one, he went against the council by vouching for ani and showed he was more one with the force than yoda

naboo at night at padme's funeral procession looks appropriately haunting

aw, padme is holding ani's pendant he gave her in episode one, much tragic

darth, vader, and cg tarkin?</TEXT>

utapau looks part amazing, part too much cg like geonosis

windu says if they destroy sheev, theyll have to take control of the govt to ensure a peaceful transition, yoda says "to a dark place this line of thought takes us," which raises an interesting dilemma, do the jedi have to become more like the sith to defeat them?</TEXT>

ani's dialogue about pledging himself is rushed, but hayden does a great job of selling it 

sheev knows he still has to convince ani to do his bidding, makes a seductive argument about having to eliminate to jedi to prevent a civil war 

the killing of the tusken raiders' children was a nice setup for the killing of the younglings at the temple 

sheev says once more the sith will rule the galaxy and theyll have peace, and come to think of it, was life in the empire really that bad?</TEXT>

senate applauding sheev's proclamation that republic will be replaced with an empire, it must be sheev's senators 

obi and yoda recalibrated code to warn jedi to stay away from the temple, I guess empire hunted them down before the ot

obi really believed in ani, shouldve known it was ani who killed younglings but still had to check security holograms

security hologram of sheev and ani, were the jedi bugging sheev?</TEXT>

obi goes to padme to find out where ani's gone, so he knew they were lovers but hadnt said anything

obi now stowing away on padme's ship, hes becoming more like qui gon, using deceit when needed, maybe qui gon (and mace, not like the jedi hadnt killed before) was on to something, not being so rigid in dogma as the jedi had become 

the viceroy is trying to tell ani the truth, that hes been working with sheev,  ut ani is too far gone and kills him

I love padme taking a moment before confronting ani, it's a nice moment alone with her

portman runs to ani, not really something a pregnant woman would do

lol ani smirks big time when padme says obi wants to help them, he really thinks hes all powerful and doesnt need any help

padme says let's run away and ani gives his "I am the one who knocks" speech

wow ani was going to overthrow sheev and I think he couldve but then he got fucked up by obi

ani and padme are acting great here 

I love ani circling obi before their duel like a dance

ha its the blue business guy that was said to be buying off the senators from episode one now standing with sheev

I dont think yoda shouldve gotten hit by sheev's lightning, he had blocked dooku's in episode two easily

ani and obi fighting in the hallway, lights going off and on for a strobe effect, every movie lucas does this it works

ani just jump kicked obi like obi jump kicked jango, lol still weird when they do this 

yoda and sheev fighting on senate floor, this is perfect

dual force pushes by ani and obi, yes!</TEXT>

uh oh, ani just hit the computer, love how elaborate the action set pieces are

yoda repels sheev's blast and sends them both falling but only yoda falls, it's almost as if it was fate that decided which would win

I still think yoda shouldve beaten sheev but I guess then thered be no ot

it bugs me during the heavy cg scenes when they at least dont use real foreground material

volcano going off around them looks epic

I remember yoda doing a bruce lee like wipe of his nose either vs dooku or sheev but I havent seen it on the blu ray, wonder ifnthry changed this along with puppet yoda

cool to see organa getting screen time

obi ani fight is crazy, theyre trying to kill each other while on a floating antenna on a river of lava 

obi makes a good point when he says ani is lost, though the jedi are far from perfect, theres a clear distinction between them and the sith

obi looks like hes holding in a smile after he cuts off ani's legs

ani rocking those darth maul eyes 

obi not saving ani, he knows ani is still dangerous, nice that they didnt make it so he was cold hearted

obi comes back to the ship, c3po freaking out, obi gives him a comforting tap on the shoulder when hes the one who just nearly killed his friend and brother, what a good dude

sheev actually touches ani and looks like hes govin him comfort, well he is a master manipulator and politician and wants ani to live as his apprentice, contrast that with obi's comforting touch to c3 and padme

asteroid they're hiding on looks amazing 

nice parallel with padme giving birth while ani undergoing his operation, padme dies while vader and the twins are born

obi didnt tell padme what he did to ani before she lost her will to live so perhaps she sensed it through the force somehow

oohbah oohbah...

the scars on ani are pretty gnarly

til the end, padme believed in ani and said to obi there was good in him, I wonder how much that affected how he dealt with Luke in new hope

sheev tells ani he killed padme in his anger, ani says she couldve have, he felt she was alive, but what choice does he have but to believe the emperor at this point?</TEXT>

room where organa, obi and yoda convene looks like from an 80s video game but hey it's a real set

yoda tells obi he will teach him how to commune with qui gon, that hees masterpiece d immort, pretty awesome that qui gon mastered immortality first, the true way, unlike sheev's way, and it makes sense qui gon was the one, he went against the council by vouching for ani and showed he was more one with the force than yoda

naboo at night at padme's funeral procession looks appropriately haunting

aw, padme is holding ani's pendant he gave her in episode one, much tragic

darth, vader, and cg tarkin?</TEXT>

the nemoidian talking to grievous doesnt have a bad asian accent like in episode one, also I recall the one in episode two didnt have it either, you cant say lucas didnt try to improve 

obi wan and anakin take out an elevator full of droids, anakin seems like his powers have indeed doubled 

anakin and obi wans bickering seems also to have matured, they really are more like brothers now

lol at the rivalry between obi wan and anakin about r2 and implicitly r4

three way fight with dooku begins, much has been said about spinning and jumping shit, but there is real weight and tension in each attack here

they did a good job replacing dooku's head with cg

lol the extra reason for anakin not to kill dooku came after he killed him, so hes needing less reason to kill.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> I wonder if Palpatine somehow gave anakin the edge over dooku

I thought anakins outfit was black but now I think it might be more of a dark brown, if so, a nice progression from light to dark

classic side of ship to side of ship firing, but in space

I cant help but wonder what dooku's republic wouldve looked like, he knew the corruption in the senate and jedi council to an extent but also fought as a sith

grievous looks amazing

"youre a lot shorter than I expected," "jedi scum", the humor without jar jar is just the right tone 

love how the good guys keep getting captured

those roman sentry droids look cool

anakin trying to land says "extend all flaps and drag fins", lucas' love of flying is showing 

sheev looks actually worried hes going to die lol

the problem qui gon had reacting to the green screen during the fish attack in episode one doesnt look like a problem anymore during the landing with anakin and obi 

great shot of ani and obi getting close to camera as they land

coruscant still looks amazing

its shameful how manipulated the jedi council was by sheev

sam jackson needs to say motherfucker once and id be complete

padme rocking the buns, so much hotter than leia

hes eventually happy but i wonder why ani hesitates when padme says shes pregnant

coruscant at night is blade runnerish

love john williams music from start to finish of all the movies

dayum, hayden without his shirt, has filled out nicely

padme's apartment seems to have the best view of all of coruscant 

ani is revealing his premonition to padme and hayden is acting circles around natalie

seeing the jedi temple reminded me of a thought from episode 2, the youngling who gives the answer to where kamino is looks like the same youngling anakin kills at the end 

aang from avatar goes through same dilemma as ani when theyre told to let go of love, here it's clearly an either or situation, I forget how avatar resolved it but he did end up happily with katara and his powers didnt suffer

palpatine gets granted more emergency powers to fight the war, reminds me of bush

obi warns ani to beware palpatine and in next scene, palpatine says trust me, he mustve sensed ani's doubt 

sheev putting anakin on the council is a masterful move and so is the council asking ani to be a double agent, poor ani, much tragedy

ani takes the request and everything personally, obi reminds him it's not him asking, I seem to remember maybe in the clone war series there was an answer to this dilemma of balancing love and the force

make star fucking wars

spearhead creation of indiana jones franchise 

create ilm thats done cgi for every big tentpole like jurassic park

inspired james fucking cameron to get into movies

give fans up close look of how star wars was made because you want to share, knowledge they will later use against you because they have no fucking clue how collaborative movie and tv industry is

decide to fix a few things always wrong with ot, most good which goes unnoticed, some you prob should have left alone, but hey those fans will still have the originals 

but at this point no one says no because youre george fucking lucas 

decide to finally give fans what they want and creates the prequels

no one says no when you decide to push boundaries of film again and film mostly with green screen (though no one remembers you still used a shit ton of practical effects and sets and models).</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>

no one says no when you create jar jar

no one says no when you go for a cinematagraphic look that is too clean which makes the cgi more sterile (though thematically makes sense, light to ot's dark)

but you got bombass music from john williams for ot

and ewan mcgregor as obi wan and liam neeson as qui gon

and a story that parallels nazi Germany's rise

and does the exposition work needed for ot to make sense

also sweetass worlds like the wookies'

fanboys revolt and say you ruined their childhood, bully jake lloyd into mental illness

you get fed up with fanboys but still want them see your life's work continue and sell it to Disney

they reject most of your story ideas and instead rehash new hope which is opposite of what new hope was, intended to break new ground

you see fanboys love the rehash and start even comparing it to the ot

you see another director like peter jackson fuck up but not get nearly enouh same hate

a minority of lucas fans know what you did, and shit like midichlorians are just a sign of the force, not the force itself

but majority hate you

fans become as emotional and ugly and controlling like the sith despite what you tried to teach them in the movies 

you have no idea why your work has suddenly become so unpopular

because you were george fucking lucas</TEXT>

Also I'd like to point out for those who haven't watched the extras on the prequels that it had many sets (iirc 72, rewatching now and much fewer green screen was used, most of ship scenes were on sets including ; models, and existing locations (most of the Naboo scenes were shot in Italy, desert scenes in Tunisia, Anakin and Amidala's retreat in episode 2, Uncle Owen' home, they rebuilt the corridor from a picture of one from episode 4 for the ship in episode 3).</TEXT>

Two more points: the ot had the equivalent green screen use in its use of matte paintings throughout, to name the ones off the top of my head, Luke and Leia's rope swinging scene in the Death Star, the fighter launch bay at the end of movie one, the exterior shot of Cloud City.</TEXT>

Tldr: Lucas has pushed the envelope his entire career and with the prequels, has been misunderstood

An aside: I believe the pent up demand for more Star Wars was so great that anything other than nearly exact clones of the ot would have satisfied the fanbase which is why TFA was so popular, moreso when the prequels didn't give the fans exactly that (yes I'll be the first to admit it had its flaws but the shame is completely dismissing its highs, and it came from an older and more meditative filmmaker).</TEXT>

Also, Lucas had been perhaps too transparent giving fans an inside look at how the sausage was made so some of the magic was taken away, and so it was easy to armchair quarterback his decisions as a director which were reduced to his working with talented people when it is par for the course and to have many bad ideas on the table to get to the good ones.</TEXT>

Get Out average critic rating 8.3 vs 99

Split 6.4 vs 76

Moonlight 9.0 vs 97

Manchester by the Sea 8.9 vs 96

La La Land 8.6 vs 93

Rogue One 7.5 vs 85

Arrival 8.4 vs 94

I find the average critic score much more in line with the percent of my enjoyment/quality of the movies

make star fucking wars

spearhead creation of indiana jones franchise

create ilm thats done cgi for every big tentpole like jurassic park

inspired james fucking cameron to get into movies

give fans up close look of how star wars was made because you want to share, knowledge they will later use against you because they have no fucking clue how collaborative movie and tv industry is, and later what an exec producer does

decide to fix a few things always wrong with ot, most good which goes unnoticed, some you prob should have left alone, but hey those fans will still have the originals 

but at this point no one says no because youre george fucking lucas 

decide to finally give fans what they want and creates the prequels

no one says no when you decide to push boundaries of film again and film mostly with green screen (though no one remembers you still used a shit ton of practical effects and sets and models).</TEXT>

no one says no when you create jar jar

no one says no when you go for a cinematagraphic look that is too clean which makes the cgi more sterile (though thematically makes sense, light to ot's dark)

but you got bombass music from john williams for ot

and ewan mcgregor as obi wan and liam neeson as qui gon and sam jackson with a purple lightsaber

and a story that parallels nazi Germany's rise

and does the exposition work needed for ot to make sense

also sweetass worlds like the wookies'

fanboys revolt and say you ruined their childhood, bully jake lloyd into mental illness

you get fed up with fanboys but still want them see your life's work continue and sell it to Disney

they reject most of your story ideas which is fine but instead rehash new hope which is opposite of what new hope was, intended to break new ground

you see fanboys love the rehash and start even comparing it to the ot

you see another director like peter jackson fuck up but not get nearly enough same hate

a minority of lucas fans know what you did, that midichlorians are just identifiers of a force sensitive person, not the source

but majority hate you

despite james fucking cameron, who has now internalized the star wars mantra of show them something new, coming to your defense and calling tfa a "reentrenchment"

fans become as emotional and ugly and controlling like the sith despite what you tried to teach them in the movies 

even make a sub on reddit hating on the prequels though with an undercurrent of love 

you have no idea why your work has suddenly become so unpopular

because you were george fucking lucas</TEXT>

no one says no when you decide to push boundaries of film again and film mostly with green screen (though no one remembers you still used a shit ton of practical effects and sets and models).</TEXT>

no one says no when you create jar jar

no one says no when you go for a cinematagraphic look that is too clean which makes the cgi more sterile (though thematically makes sense, light to ot's dark)

but you got bombass music from john williams for ot

and ewan mcgregor as obi wan and liam neeson as qui gon

and a story that parallels nazi Germany's rise

and does the exposition work needed for ot to make sense

also sweetass worlds like the wookies'

fanboys revolt and say you ruined their childhood, bully jake lloyd into mental illness

you get fed up with fanboys but still want them see your life's work continue and sell it to Disney

they reject most of your story ideas and instead rehash new hope which is opposite of what new hope was, intended to break new ground

you see fanboys love the rehash and start even comparing it to the ot

you see another director like peter jackson fuck up but not get nearly enouh same hate

a minority of lucas fans know what you did, and shit like midichlorians are just a sign of the force, not the force itself

but majority hate you

fans become as emotional and ugly and controlling like the sith despite what you tried to teach them in the movies 

you have no idea why your work has suddenly become so unpopular

because you were george fucking lucas</TEXT>

Also I'd like to point out for those who haven't watched the extras on the prequels that many sets (iirc 72), models, and existing locations (the govt building at the end of eps 1, Anakin and Amidala's retreat in episode 2, Uncle Owen' home, they rebuilt the corridor from a picture of one from episode 4 for the ship in episode 3).</TEXT>

Two more points: the ot had the equivalent green screen use in its use of matte paintings throughout, to name the ones off the top of my head, Luke and Leia's rope swinging scene in the Death Star, the fighter launch bay at the end of movie one, the exterior shot of Cloud City.</TEXT>

Tldr: Lucas has pushed the envelope his entire career and with the prequels, has been misunderstood

An aside: I believe the pent up demand for more Star Wars was so great that anything other than nearly exact clones of the ot would have satisfied the fanbase which is why TFA was so popular, moreover when the prequels didn't give the fans exactly that (yes I'll be the first to admit it had its flaws but the shame is completely dismissing its highs, and it came from an older and more meditative filmmaker) Lucas had been perhaps too transparent giving fans an inside look at how the sausage was made so some of the magic was taken away, and so it was easy to armchair quarterback his decisions as a director which were reduced to his working with talented people when it is par for the course to have many bad ideas on the table to get to the good ones.</TEXT>

Work keeps me busy and going to the theater is a trek so staying home is easier

The image at home is HD so not too bad

I think there's a misconception there is more blue screen than actually used because the prequels are the most obvious example but that had been the trend in blockbusters, the original trilogy didn't use it nearly as much because the technology was nascent but now nearly every movie and show uses it for even basic scenes, and aesthetically it looks so clean that real objects are mistaken for digital as you'll see below, but it makes sense to the story as the Republic was at peace.</TEXT>

Lucas due to his mandate to show audiences new things as he had with the original trilogy at times took it too far but that's from a well-intentioned desire and boldness that we loved the OT for.</TEXT>
