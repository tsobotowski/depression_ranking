            	<TEXT> Well going on the new Star Wars film coming out soon, it's really refreshing seeing them go back to its roots

I wish it would become the way forward for all studios now to see the benefits of real sets and practical effects

I think bad practical effects can stick out like a white elephant but at least practical models and effects will always age well whereas bad CGI never ages well and looks bland after a few years

In decades time you will always believe another world in older films because it is all real, nothing was faked whereas older CGI oriented films will look ropey as hell and because it was largely faked and made up, nothing is real to believe

I would say look at Jaws as a prime example, they had 3 model sharks that hardly ever worked but the film was a masterpiece, instead of having the shark as the focus, it had great characters and put suspense and that music to full effect meaning what you didn't see was far more unnerving

CGI in 3D looks ridiculous no matter how much money they throw at it, it will always look fake, then there is IMAX, I wish this format was the standard in films nowadays, all films should fill the frame and be as real and clear as possible, Nolan's Batman films are a shining example of it being used correctly</TEXT>

Then there's The Flying Graysons, why only one episode and have their dispute resolved in one episode, they should have still had their dispute but come back in season 2 having resolved issues, then at least we would have believed it and it would be a great motif every season to have them return for a few episodes

Then there's Arkham, the whole Arkham promise has not been lived up to and should have been given far more attention, Gordon should have had a part time role in there for half the season then we would have gotten lots of little side stories featuring the odd villian we all know and would have been the great place to throw in Easter Eggs like colours / sounds / symbols / costume nods, it would have been a real treat for fans know this week they may get some little nods to the Batman universe</TEXT>

She should have gone underground in the city then we would have had many useful episodes with her amassing her recruits and indeed luring Selena along, Ivy would have been included as well am sure or would have been on hand and picking up tips for her future self, maybe a young Harley would have been around as well

All this would have laid great groundwork for future younger villains but instead they put her on that god awful island which was a totally pointless plot device and detracted from everything else</TEXT>

From multiple personalities to what next

I'd love it if he went on a sadistic spree under the radar for an entire season

Be good to have him conflicting himself, like someone self imploding every second

Like self doubting his own motives, his every move, the truest form of insanity

This would be an epic descent in to the world he becomes but what of Ms Kringle

Maybe she will be the ultimate catalyst for his ascension to the dark side, she's such a cock blocker lol

If she carries on teasing and messing with his head, you'd not blame him for ultimately slaughtering her</TEXT>

Then the US had various shows from Sightings to Unsolved Mysteries with Robert Stack

There were other themed shows like Outer Limits but not factual reconstruction TV shows

I would love to see the complete Robert Stack Unsolved Mysteries episodes but you can't stream any online thanks to the guys that own the modern inferior version hosted by Dennis Farina which changed the theme tune and gave it a very boring studio feel with non of the charm Robert Stack gave</TEXT>

Seen they're having standalone apps for these tasks so is there a need for WMP, I have used it for years to transfer files to music device but version 12 hadn't really changed from XP and still had outdated options, codecs and functionality, it could have been so much more 

They should have merged Media Centre with WMP and tied in massive downloads services like iTunes, think then Microsoft would've stayed relevant instead of getting lagged behind for many years  </TEXT>

One of the things that drived the series was the sexual tension / chemistry between them, the will it or won't it happen every week, it's what kept us coming back for more

So with this no longer an issue, will there still be a spark between them that will produce great scenes, maybe they could add more humour to compensate like a lover's tiff kind of banter between them, that would be entertaining</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> Yeah me too but it's an odd character to get behind anyway, think early in the season she should have had interests to follow, I heard she was an attorney or something

It would be great if she pursued some job like that and stirs things up in GCPD for Gordon then at night the claws come out and she has an alternate life</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> Going on the recent Comic Con panel, I get the impression that she feels like a black sheep on there, not getting any notice and given garbage material to work with

Bruno Heller and the writers not giving her any real respect and other actors all getting the star treatment, I feel really bad for the actress

She can obviously act and am sure given enough scenes she would shine, she is a lot more interesting than Morena Baccarin in a non ego kind of way, like more open and willing to speak to people

She should be given more meat to chew on, more things to grasp, it seems the writers are embarrassed how they have written her into a corner and seemed like they made a mistake with her at the beginning and are wishing the character away so are choosing an easy way out by making her psychotic</TEXT>

Also, Cat is basically like her future self but more leather needed

Ivy who I adore wears a Freddy Krueger style jumper, maybe latex will be her thing when she gets older

Not talking about Batman yet but maybe the final scene in season two will have him fall down the well to be surrounded by bats, that would be a fitting end to season two</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> Is it just me or did she kind of enjoy pummelling Barbara's head on the floor

I think also in scenes especially the Jerome episode, she did seem a bit snappy

So it's my guess that maybe she will turn bad while Barbara will turn good

She does seem secretive so will have some skeletons in the closet am sure

We have all seen Barbara's so maybe when Leslie turns sour, Babs could have redemption

I think it would be good for Babs that Leslie may do something damaging for Gordon and Babs picks up on it and does something heroic to save Gordon which could either be the making / breaking of Babs

Leslie on the other hand could have been anything before working in Arkham but nothing was said about her past, I think she will show her true colours soon, hopefully</TEXT>

Maybe in the final season finale it has to be played over the last scenes, they need to do a homage when the final season ends and the prisoners all go on to pastures new

It would need to be Lynne Hamilton credited in the last episode as that song is probably more remembered than any of the Cell Block H characters</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> These are the albums that got me in to dance music, the mixed ones in particular were generally some of the best ever released especially the first 5-10 which were the pinnacle golden age but in latter years they went down hill a bit and went too commercial and the mixed era died along with the brand, it still lives on but only to make Ministry of Sound money, the craft and care of the originals were something special and touched your mind, body and soul, the highest state of euphoria

These are about the best euphoric ones they ever released...

            	<TEXT> Well, we have had a lot of Fish and Cat and not a lot of Ivy, poor Pepper and then there's Leslie and Montoya then there's Barbara who has been a mess all season, what were the writers thinking and then there's Victor's mistresses, Penguin's mum and various fleeting characters like Robin's mother and that's about it

Outweigh this with multiple sausages and testosterone fuelled nonsense, can we have more totty in season 2 please?</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> Obviously we will deal with the aftermath of last season but the producers have said that season 1 was mapped out to much fewer episodes as that's what was given meaning the rest of the season was padded out

So they say that season 2 will arc the entire run meaning it will be less panicked and cobbled together so am hoping for a more cohesive storyline with various arcs and can we get the Court of Owls please?</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1307_118_1</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT> Here's my take on his entrance in season 2

He wonders in to Falcone's house during the episode maybe at the end of the first one, he looks around an empty house with a bemused look on his face then he enters Falcone's office with the chair facing the wall

Then all of a sudden, the chair swings around like Blofeld in James Bond, it is Penguin

Zsasz thinks WTF then Penguin grins and begins a sombre laugh

Episode ends

Then next episode, Victor decides not to work for Penguin and goes solo, meaning him against Penguin and Gotham, holy moly</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> Would be a great little nod to the Adam West series if they put an old rotary bright red telephone somewhere preferably in Wayne Manor

It wouldn't need to be anything cheesy it could be in Bruce's bedroom somewhere as the camera pans across or amongst his possessions</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> I sure hope they give her far more screen time next season as she has barely been noticeable in the first season and the young actress Clare Foley is a great choice, very creepy but strangely alluring for a kid but largely under utilised

We need to see her pull more pranks and see her back story with her parents and what she gets up to, Ivy has just as much influence in the Batman universe as Cat but it seems Cat has gotten all the attention in season one</TEXT>
