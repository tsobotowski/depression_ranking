There are so many other great touches throughout - Ed Harris's reflective narration about life to anchor the overblown satire to some grounding (with an excellent bit of score - [Du Bois](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WFs4MJWLfeM)), the toe-shooting sequence, the Rock's acting of being high, the scenes shot in Bay's own house, Tony Shalhoub's performance.</TEXT>

Some say "doesn't matter, most apps rotate the screen anyway" but its too annoying, e.g:  
Cmoar cinema: (and I'm sure most other cinema apps) doesn't preserve the correct 3D once its flipped, also the tracking is completely affected, often horizontal motion completely freezes.</TEXT>

I don't fancy re-soldering to the mic board as its tiny, but something I might try is cutting the cable near the mic board, soldering/twisting/wrapping as many leads as I need to extend the cable as much as I need to, then carefully fixing the dodgier section of cable along the underside of the front panel so that the decent end is free to be connected to the right side.</TEXT>

Firstly, it doesn't define regression.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_688_1058_33</DOCNO>

            	<DOCNO>s_688_1058_35</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>

Second is that regression can be useful, in some contexts, e.g. unlocking repressed memories etc.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_688_1058_36</DOCNO>

            	<DOCNO>s_688_1058_38</DOCNO>

            	<DOCNO>s_688_1058_39</DOCNO>

Thirdly, because something like regression doesn't necessarily prove something happened, it doesn't prove it didn't happen either.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_688_1058_40</DOCNO>

Some favourites are:
**Spy Game** (some good sneaking around / action)
**Breach** (some good sneaking around)

Tinker Tailor is great, but there's not much sneaking around or spying.</TEXT>

Edit: (added) Fight Club, Shawshank, Rush, The Prestige, Sleuth, Moon, Two Faces of January, In Bruges

I wouldnt really include films like Lethal Weapon, Kiss Kiss Bang Bang, Crimson Tide, Usual Suspects (for the Chazz/Spacey dynamic) as the relationships in those movies arguably don't really form the focus of the films compellingness.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> Two variables I've noticed that make a massive difference on the experience of a film (found through watching some films 2 or 3 times at the cinema):

            	<TEXT>With something like **Gravity** its best to sit close (where 3D is also enhanced due to wider parallax), whilst something like **Captain Phillips** (or shaky-cam movies) is best to sit further back to absorb the image easier.</TEXT>
