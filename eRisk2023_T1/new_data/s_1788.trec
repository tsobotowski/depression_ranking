            	<TEXT>He is by far my favourite and is so unappreciatied by a lot of fans he is easily the best actor we have had for the doctor and his doctor actually goes on a story arc learning if he truly is a good man and his last story is incredibly dark like he is essentially considering sucide in time lord fashion I just love how grumpy he is but yet how kind and caring he is in the inside almost the opersit yo tennant and yes I like Clara she was way better with capaldi than smith</TEXT>
