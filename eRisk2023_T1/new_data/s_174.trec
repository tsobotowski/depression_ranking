Honestly I was tired here, but here is what i remember:  

game one: We had some back and forth, my opponent had a chalice which was invalidated by vial except in two ways that only came up because I drew the one of dread return and the game one configuration of the deck couldn't cast it naturally, which if I'd realized so earlier I could have just spent 2 turns drawing up to 8 cards so I could discard it, as I had dealt with the first bit of pressure.</TEXT>

I mostly agree with you, with the caveat that having a slot that does something instead of nothing and that synergizes with sideboard options in a minor fashion makes bug midrange strategies better against storm by a minor amount, which is compounded by the surge in this type of deck to make a not insignificant change in the meta.</TEXT>
