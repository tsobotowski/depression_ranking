Our lone star flag's the waviest

Our fried steak's the cream-graviest 

Our rattlesnakes the coiliest

Our beaches are the oiliest 

Our politicians most corrupt

Our stop signs most abrupt

Our guitars are the twangiest

Our guns are the ka-blangiest

Our cattle the long-horniest

Our yodels the forlorniest

Our cookoffs are the chiliest

Our Waylon is the Williest

Our sausage is the smokiest

Our neighbors are the Okiest</TEXT>

Kind of a long story, but I went out of town for a couple of weeks, and her car needed repairs so she used mine while it was in the shop, and when her car was ready she drove my car downtown to pick it up, intending to come back on the bus later to get my car, only she just plumb forgot, and didn't remember till days later.</TEXT>
