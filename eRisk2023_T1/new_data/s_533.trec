Solely going off this clip (keeping in mind it's short af and realisitically hard to take anything from) it's nice to see him anticipating the strikes but i mean cmon, he bites on the feint which is something a more technical fighter (also one not sparring obviously) could land a quicker cross from, especially the way aldo just moves his head to the side rather than moving closer to the elbow.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>And then he slips the other way into the cross anyway which is like..not good :P It'd be nice to see him mix the head movement with his positioning as well, staying on the end of punches is a good way to get clipped, i like his pivot at the end though, that was nice :P 

at the end of the day, it's a short clip we can't tell much from, i'm sure he's done 100 different examples of the same thing all perfectly, but from this clip alone (and i mean just this clip alone), that wasn't a good example of someone with good head movement.</TEXT>

I am really hoping they quit it with the 'wrestlers' and the 'cruiserweight division' soon though, would open up a lot of interesting matches letting the cruiserweights match up against anyone like they used to have it, especially considering a lot top guys are pretty much technically cruiserweights, it seems silly to keep them separate  </TEXT>

admittedly that's probably on me for mentioning their alignment in the title.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> Wow, i'd much rather distance myself from that subreddit

My issue with this situation is less about gendered biases but rather the exploitation of personal issues for a better story, and the tv station playing a role (right or wrong) in matters where they otherwise had no right to do so

Also just to be clear i dont mean to suddenly jump down your throat, whether you were simply making an observation or simply hold different beliefs is totally cool.</TEXT>

but it's definitely an issue where the only people who know what happened are the people involved, and if he stole away his family he's a bit of a dick, but it sorta works both ways in a he said she said way which i think became outstandingly messy when tv ratings got involved  </TEXT>
