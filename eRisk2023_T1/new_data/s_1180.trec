            	<DOCNO>s_1180_469_4</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>So our depth chart at the moment PG: Luka/Miles SG: Grimes/IQ SF: RJ/Knox PF: Randle/Obi C: Mitch This leaves a need for a Starting PG, back up SF, back up C, and the 3rd string players to fill out the bench **Cap Space** I couldnt find out how much Miles will be making so i'll assume its 1.4 a year Adding in Grimes contract we have around 60 Million in guaranteed contracts With the salary cap at 112 million this year we have **Cap Space: 52 Million** **Point Guard** Options Mike Conley, Kyle Lowry, Spencer Dinwiddie, Lonzo Ball, Dennis Schroder, Goran Dragic, Derrick Rose Realistically,my priority picks would be Lowry and Conley and 2/50 deals.</TEXT>
        </DOC>
        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1180_469_5</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>But Mike would be smarter to stay with Utah since he's probably priorizing winning and the Jazz are closer to contenders than the Knicks Lowry could be an option since he already won, maybe he'll accept the bag we'll throw at him and would appreciate being closer to home Lonzo is someone who i'd be content but not extremely happy with.</TEXT>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1180_469_6</DOCNO>

        <DOC>
            	<DOCNO>s_1180_469_8</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>With this i'll assume we give Lonzo a 4 year 90 Million dollar deal This brings our cap space down to 30 million **Shooting Guards** I'll skip this and you'll see why later **Small Forwards** Not much to talk about here, i see us giving Reggie Bullock 3/30 Cap space drops to 15 Million **Power Forwards/Centers** I'll lump these two together because some guys can play both positions Options Taj Gibson, Trey Lyles, James Johnson, Nerlens Noel, JaVale Mcgee, Dwight Howard, I want Nerlens back, not sure if we have the money for him, hopefully he would accept a 3 year deal starting at 15 million a year.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1180_469_12</DOCNO>
            	<TEXT>One would say he could get more but hes made a ton of money in his career from the NBA and endorsements so maybe staying with a team he likes and coach he likes would take priority over a bit more money.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>SG should consider giving her an EE that gives 7-14% Effectiveness I think her artifact should be what gets upgraded imo, give her 100% chance to land a bomb off the jump and then let the artifact have effectiveness that starts at 15% and ends at 30% max limit broken It eases the gear requirement a little bit if they can do that and allows us to give her a bit more bulk so she doesnt get instantly deleted</TEXT>
