Theoretically if I update the master file, the changes should ripple across any file that uses that link - which it does if you open the file in Illustrator on the computer it was originally created on.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1602_555_6</DOCNO>

My workaround for this is to open up all the files that uses the linked master file, select something, nudge it and nudge it back and then save.</TEXT>

            	<DOCNO>s_1602_555_7</DOCNO>

            	<TEXT>

It has been an absolute chore to do this, each brand I work with has at a minimum of 40 different files that uses linked placement and if there's a small change like say a new phone number I have to change it on all the master files then open up all the files that references the linked files, nudge, nudge back, and save.</TEXT>

So my initial question is: is there a way to update a bunch of files all at once ensuring that the linked files are refreshed and is displaying the latest save of the master file?</TEXT>

Also, have I approached this situation correctly in using the "placed linked" file or is there a much better, more efficient way of handling this?</TEXT>

stumbled [on this thread](http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=60136403 postcount=46) and downloaded an official rom but flashing fails after authentication:

He said he was on 5.0, stock rooted stock rom - he told me he was sick and tired of the 5.1 update notification and tried to unroot to update and now it's soft-bricked.</TEXT>

here's a screen of all the firmwares and softwares and roms I've tried flashing every which way possible

* Cucumber
* Berries (varies depending on season and availabilty) 

What you see there is divided into four batches which yields six large mason jars:

So per batch I use about 2 teaspoons of matcha, just a little over a cup of milk, roughly two carrots, one and a quarter banana, half a cucumber, one egg (although sometimes i'll scramble and egg and divide that into four), half an avocado, 1 half bushel of kale, a quarter of the large bag of spinach, a large handful of berries, and the honey is added last to adjust for taste, it changes depending how sweet the berries and bananas are.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> So my friends and I all took advantage of the upgrade price when win8 first launched and of course the keys we have only work for a win8 build, not win8.1, which is fine and all but when we have to format for whatever reason (like a new pc build) we'll have to install via the usb key we created from the microsoft website.</TEXT>

I've checked my propellers, they "seem fine" (i'm guessing i'm just looking for eveness and imperfections); looked at the cogs and such, nothing astray there; reset the drone with a toothpick multiple times, and i've pressed the 'flat trim' a thousand times but nothing has worked!</TEXT>

There's definitely something a matter with one of the motors, i'm not sure which one but if i just hold the drone and take off, i can hear stutters - i'll try and shoot a video and post it for clarity but in the meantime i would appreciate absolutely any input!</TEXT>

I've googled far and wide and have re-installed the drivers but haven't had any luck, I've also ordered the an [EVGA branded SLI bridge](http://amzn.com/B00F93S5DM) and it should be here at the end of week but in the meantime I was wondering if anyone has any insight on this issue that doesn't concern the bridge itself.</TEXT>

There's just too many factors when working for a big company that still thinks ciga-likes are "in"; after convincing the execs to at least start with ego-style batteries I freshened up form-factor of the ego and threw a micro-usb-passthrough port on it instead of that outdated mini USB.</TEXT>

I feel so ashamed when I read all the negative things about my product line because I've fought tooth and nail to get it right but at the end of the day I've got to follow what the owner of the company wants and so much compromise is made =[

This particular display was designed for a different company to add their juice above ours but we have no affiliation with vaporX, in fact, they are our direct competition - our juices are ok, they aren't bad but as a person who sells a ton of DiY to friends and family, the FAZE line of juices doesn't compare.</TEXT>

I currently use PlayerPRO to listen to my audio which used to work fine with the e17 but now it doesn't recognize it as an audio output; my assumption was that it was broken system wide but then i downloaded a trial version of "USB Audio Player PRO" (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.extreamsd.usbaudioplayerpro) and this app recognizes my e17 fine!</TEXT>

I scoured the internet and found several sites that offer replacement PCBs for the drive and have made an order, found one for $20 after shipping - hopefully I can just replace the PCB and this will be the end of it; it'd be a great bonus if the PCB restored the drive functionality completely!</TEXT>

It's strange, the drive has its moments where it'll run and read for 10minutes and when it loses power it wont read a single file unless I detach it from my Seagate interface for a while.</TEXT>

My most recent ex moved in with me before we even got together (I've been completely independent since I was 17), we were together for 4 years: obviously living together for a little while longer than that, bought a car together and one day I bought a town home for her  a few months after the purchase of an overpriced town home (we got it right before the market collapsed) she decided she can't handle not being able to go shopping every weekend and at the same time her parents had just opened up a business in PA, she tells me she needs to go help her parents in PA (we live in CO, her parents had moved to PA about two years into our relationship) and we agreed on trying the long distance relationship thing, in not even a week after her moving to help her parents with the business her and her family suddenly leave the country for a couple months, we promised to keep in contact while she vacationed overseas but I ended up hearing from her once during this time for a brief moment on yahoo chat, even the short e-mails I sent about every 10 days were never responded to.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>

alternatively you can start weaning yourself to a lower mg so that your throat gets used to something like 12mg and then every 30ml go up a step e.g. 12mg to 16mg after 30ml then 16mg to 18mg and then 18mg to 24mg, once you hit 24mg start the cycle over - the period where you go back to 12mg will be painful but once you're used to it it'll be satisfying when you start climbing up again.</TEXT>

We mostly cut paper products for packaging with the occasional cardboard for making display stands but more importantly card-stock, for instance we'll have to cut 5000 cards with custom die-lines and hang holes, the Graphtech just can't handle that much work.</TEXT>

Any input is appreciated, sorry for writing so much, so in summary I'm looking for an industrial flatbed plotter cutter that can handle cutting through card-stock with reputable customer service in Colorado, the budget is allowing me around $20,000.</TEXT>

I want to avoid putting on a screen protector (with adhesive ie invisible shield) on the iPad itself and stick with having a seal between the otterbox's case frame and the iPad so that I can avoid building up gunk between the frame and the iPad.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> So I've owned a place around Colorado and 104th for a while, bought the place before the market crashed and mortgage is outrageous, I wanted to refi a couple years in but the mortgage difference wasn't great enough (it would be if I refi'd now though but I'd have to be current), tried for a home modification loan and failed three times and ended up over 30K behind on mortgage so now I'm forced to short sell the house or face foreclosure - anyhow I've been searching CL, trulia and zillow for months and the only things I can find in my price range ($950/mo) are apartments or trailers.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Anyhow, I'm an in-house graphic designer that picks up freelance gigs on the side and one of the most frustrating things to deal with is clients that just don't understand design pricing; for example I could say I charge $40/hr but to make a tri-fold brochure but offer a flat rate of $350 (depending on company size) for the entire design and the client will end up resenting the price because they don't believe it'll take almost 9hrs to complete, yes in reality it doesn't take that long but I don't know how to explain the hours that are added for things like overhead, education, talent, skill etc.</TEXT>

I stumbled upon it quite a lot (in the 720, 303 and 719 area), the show was in black and white, very grainy and had this guy in an apron wearing a skull-like mask with long dark hair standing behind a table butchering meat, I can't remember what he was talking about but it definitely was not about the meat he was chopping up nor his giant cleaver, I remember his voice was all distorted much like how jigsaw presents himself in the SAW series; i do remember his topics were completely random and always thinking to myself "WTF is this!?</TEXT>
