            	<TEXT> I'm just an incredibly shitty novice but some tips would be:

Use a tripod

Use a very low shutterspeed/bulb mode

Get a lens with a low aperture number like f2.8 or lower (I've taken some decent pictures with just f3.5)

Oh and one of those remotes for your camera so you don't actually have to press the button (I don't own one so I can't tell you much about it)

Learn a little bit about iso, aperture and shutterspeed then experiment.</TEXT>
