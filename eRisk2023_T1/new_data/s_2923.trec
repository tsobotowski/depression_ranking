For example France has an ID card system to prove who you are and that you are eligible for treatment, Sweden charges a small amount for GP visits, Germany refunds the bulk of treatment costs and then the rest is refunded by private insurance etc etc all of these things were suggested for the NHS and each time cries of "evil Tories" "facsists" are screamed until nothing can be done.</TEXT>

Don't disagree with you about there being a variety of solutions but  my point is that some change is required and the reason that the Tories don't get hammered on the NHS very successfully is that the other parties know the public will only allow minor tinkering but at the same time not allow massive tax increases to put billions more into the NHS.</TEXT>
