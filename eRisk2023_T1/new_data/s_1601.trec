            	<TEXT>And back home (I emigrated 3 months ago), a doctor gave me four possible reasons: 

1) Anemia, which I do have and my iron level is always very low  

2) Stress, I do have an anxiety problem 

3) Depression, which I do have 

4) Lack of sleep  

I think it's a wonderful mix of both, but I am so thankful today's doctor did not ask many questions.</TEXT>
