Skyline shining bright with the light shows /

LAX, JFK, Heathrow /

Toronto, we even made the skies glow /

But as the lights shined below on our embargo /

We were in the clouds trying to get up past the ozone /

And finally we looked out the window /

Realized right then, we let that light go.</TEXT>
