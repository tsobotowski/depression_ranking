As far as I'm aware it is possible that Hadean detrital zircons record Earth having settled down to a modern like planet (plate tectonics, low T oceans) by 4.4 Ga; however, it is equally possible that Hadean detrital zircons record the draw-down of a massive greenhouse atmosphere, a stagnant lid lithosphere (and deep mantle melting because the mantle was hotter) and a largely
basalt crust that locally was remelted due to high radiogenic heat production and contact
metamorphism.</TEXT>

Unfortunately, our knowledge of marine ecosystems is fairly poor to say the least when it comes to abyssal habitats, and it has taken the potential for resource extraction to motivate progress in this regard:

No megafaunal studies had been undertaken in the UK-1 contract area prior to licensing in 2013... 

Interestingly previous studies have suggested that these systems are fully capable of recovering:

Tridymite Formation Pathways

The temperature regime associated with basaltic and intermediate volcanism can also provide a formation pathway for tridymite when the requisite high-SiO2 material is present... In altered basalts from Stromboli volcano (Aeolian Islands, Italy) and andesites from Augustine volcano (Alaska), the high-SiO2 host for tridymite is the residue after acid sulfate leaching of primary mafic rock (42, 43).</TEXT>

Recall the historical trend has been along the lines of 1) Hydraulic fracturing can't cause earthquakes 2) Waste water injection is the cause of the increase in earthquakes within some areas, not hydraulic fracturing 3) Hydraulic fracturing, not waste water injection, is found to generate earthquakes but they are thought to be small ( [minor earthquakes](http://www.geo.mtu.edu/UPSeis/magnitude.html)) 4) Hydraulic fracturing is linked to minor earthquakes 5) Hydraulic fracturing is linked to light earthquakes       

With the above noted, I would direct you to the following study regarding two earthquakes of 4.0Mw and 4.3Mw that occurred near Cushing Oklahoma as to better understand why these events, even though they may be barely noticeable to you, are of concern: [Reactivated faulting near Cushing, Oklahoma: Increased potential for a triggered earthquake in an area of United States strategic infrastructure](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2015GL064669/full)</TEXT>

From the paper you linked: Based on results from this study and the similarity of the conjugate strike-slip fault systems in Cushing and Prague, we suggest that a moderate-magnitude (Mw5.6) earthquake, similar to the 2011 Prague earthquake (Mw5.6), could occur at the conjugate fault intersection directly beneath the Cushing oil storage facility.</TEXT>

######Earth's Magnetic Field:

Earth's magnetic field ([MF](http://portugalmundial.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/dynamos_magfield.jpg)) can be approximated (90%) by a dipole (bar magnet) with the MF oriented ~11 from the rotational poles.</TEXT>

######Earth's Magnetic Field:

Earth's magnetic field ([MF](http://portugalmundial.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/dynamos_magfield.jpg)) can be approximated (90%) by a dipole (bar magnet) with the MF oriented ~11 from the rotational poles.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>When looking at stable isotopes (isotopes that don't decay, i.e. non radioactive) we can use ^12 C and ^13 C. ^13 C has 1 more neutron than ^12 C thus making it heavier than ^12 C so it moves slower - thus the rate at which ^12 C encounters an organism will occur more frequently than ^13 C. A few key metabolic enzymes can be quite finicky, presumably because of the mass, and so will 'prefer' ^12 C over ^13 C. This means then that life will be isotopically 'light' relative to the natural atmospheric composition.</TEXT>

C3 photosynthetic plants | -28
Thermal vent microorganisms | -33



The formula for 13C can be seen [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9413C) and essentially means that when the 13C value is reported as being positive (+) it has higher amounts of the heavier isotope, in this case ^13 C in it and is therefore isotopically heavy.</TEXT>

The other major problem with the overkill hypothesis is that the evidence, aside from statistical analysis of arrival times, is extremely scant while noting that the statistical analysis is also potentially heavily laden with incorrect assumptions, unaccounted for variables, and an inherent mathematical attribute similar to non-uniqueness found in models.</TEXT>

EDIT: I should also like to note that what ever your stance on the term 'tar sands' it's still used in the scientific literature as can be seen in [Unconventional Petroleum Geology](http://store.elsevier.com/Unconventional-Petroleum-Geology/Caineng-Zou/isbn-9780123977861/) as I've highlighted [here](http://i.imgur.com/dEubc9J.png), and can be read in the description in the hyperlink.</TEXT>

**Mountains on Io:**

A quick review of Ios mountain structures reveals mesas, plateaus, peaks, ridges, and massifs with some common morphological features between them such as rising abruptly out of the volcanic plains with virtually no headlands or foothills and often surrounded by basal scarps, tens to a few hundred meters high (Schenk et al 2001).</TEXT>

More importantly; however, plate tectonics allows you to replenish the supply of elements to a number of systems on much faster timescales, and on global scale - as opposed to slower rates, and localized events that would be typical of a body in which there was tectonism, but no plate tectonics (all bodies have tectonics, including our [moon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDmEnjwAYIY), but only Earth is known to have plate tectonics).</TEXT>

One of the classic ways to distinguish seismic waves emanating from earthquake vs. seismic waves original from blasts, including underground nuclear tests, is that the energy from explosions is all directed radially outwards, while the initial pulse of energy from earthquakes is compressional in some quadrants, but dilatational in others.</TEXT>

Intensity is measured using [The Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercalli_intensity_scale) where as the  Richter Scale (used when applicable, on smaller earthquakes and the [moment magnitude scale](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_magnitude_scale) (Mw) on larger earthquakes) is base 10 logarithmic scale and measures how much seismic energy is released.</TEXT>

The locked portion of the thrust fault is roughly [1000km long and 100km in width](http://i.imgur.com/JBDR3u1.jpg) so the area is 100,000km^2 or 1x10^11 m^2 .</TEXT>

Thus Mo = (4.5x10^10 N/m^2 )(1x10^11 m^2 )(12.6m) = 5.67x10^22 Nm

Plugging Mo into the equation for the moment magnitude scale we get the following:

Mw = (2/3)(Log_10Mo)-6.0

Mw = (2/3)(Log_10 5.67x10^22 Nm) - 6.0

Mw = 9.2

**TL; DR** - the potential magnitude of the expected mega-thrust EQ is M9.2

I'm sure your calculations hold some meaning

It means that the expected EQ would measure 9.2Mw (or in non-Swahili, a M9.2 on the [Richter scale](http://i.imgur.com/kVsvEzf.jpg) which is a [logarithmic scale](http://www.sms-tsunami-warning.com/theme/tsunami/img/earthquakes/richter-scale/richter_scale_graphic_representation.gif))

Thus Mo = (4.5x10^10 N/m^2 )(1x10^11 m^2 )(12.6m) = 5.67x10^22 Nm

Plugging Mo into the equation for the moment magnitude scale we get the following:

Mw = (2/3)(Log_10Mo)-6.0

Mw = (2/3)(Log_10 5.67x10^22 Nm) - 6.0

Mw = 9.2

**TL; DR** - the potential magnitude of the expected mega-thrust EQ is M9.2</TEXT>

[The Higgs particle, or Higgs boson, is the vestige of the simplest proposed model of what created the Higgs field in the first place.](http://www.thehindu.com/sci-tech/science/article2714897.ece)

But...

[The Higgs Boson is unstable - it lasts a fraction of a nanosecond before decaying into more stable particles](http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/evolution/162362446.html?cmpid=15585797)

Given that it decays so fast (and I'm assuming that the generation of the hb is less common in the modern universe than it was in the early universe) is the hf weakening with time and as such, was the universe heavier during the earlier eras than it is today, and if so - do evolutionary models of the cosmos factor in this variable?</TEXT>

            	<TEXT> So I've been wanting to add a pallasite sample to my rock collection and I've been looking into it for a bit now and noticed some on eBay that are relatively inexpensive; however, they are the "[rusters](http://www.arizonaskiesmeteorites.com/AZ_Skies_Links/Stony_Irons/index.html)" and are unstable.</TEXT>

            	<TEXT>Looking at the stable pallasites is far out of my price range at the moment, and likely for some time so it got me wondering...
A) What is it about their composition that makes one stable vs. unstable?</TEXT>

B) Couldn't you just vacuum seal a "ruster" to prevent it from rusting and falling apart?</TEXT>

There would be no electrostatic force involved and I would assume their gravity would be too small to have any great effect within the time frame that we believe our solar system formed in...</TEXT>
